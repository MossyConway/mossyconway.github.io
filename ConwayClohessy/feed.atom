I chose to leave that part of the tree out until I had a better understanding, because it wasn't clear where the diffeences were coming from. I can now add the relevant people to the tree. Thanks to Jerry Russell and Hugh Sweeney for the information.</content><published>2018-03-15T11:02:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>tag:mossyconway.github.io/ConwayClohessy/2</id><title>New Year, New People</title><updated>2018-01-01T12:37:00+00:00</updated><content>Added James Sullivan, Clothilde Cusack, Agnes Gleeson, Bridie Gleeson, Eily Gleeson, Kathleen Geary, Bridget Ryan, May Ryan, Burdis Redford, Luke Hartigan,</content><published>2018-01-01T12:37:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>tag:mossyconway.github.io/ConwayClohessy/1</id><title>Move Along Please, Nothing To See Here (Yet!)</title><updated>2017-12-22T12:00:00+00:00</updated><content>The web site has only just been published, so no updates yet, give it some time.</content><published>2017-12-22T12:00:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
