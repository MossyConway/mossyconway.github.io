            SAD DROWNING FATALITY IN THE CITY
           </p>
           <p>
            A very painful feeling was caused in city circles yesterday morning, when it become known that Mr. Thomas Conway, licensed vintner, George street, had accidentally lost his life by drowning. Mr. Conway, who was in his 43rd year, was in his usual health on Thursday, attended to business, and left his house during the night to post a letter; then, according to his usual practice, intending to take a walk before retiring to rest. He was seen passing in the direction of Wellesley Bridge some few minutes before 11 o'clock, and that appears to be the last time he was seen alive. He was then perfectly cool and collected. Yesterday morning some fishermen getting ashore at the North Strand discovered him lying face downwards on the beach near the small bridge leading to Barrington's bank, and the occurrence being reported to the Thomondgate police, the remains were recovered and conveyed to the residence of the lamented deceased. Mr. Conway, as stated was in the prime of life. He was a native of the country, having been born at Boherlode, near Cahercornlish, but he had been at business in the city for several years back. Personally, he was a great favourite, courteous and obliging on all occasions. There is, as evidenced at the inquiry, great sympathy with his widow and relatives, and the sad end of the deceased caused quite a gloom among a large circle of the friends and acquaintances of Mr. Conway.
           </p>
           <p>
            Inquest
            <br/>
            Mr. James F. Barry, J.P., City Coroner, held an inquest at three o'clock, at the residence of the deceased, as to the cause of death.
            <br/>
            The following were the jury - George Clancy (foreman), William Savin, John Casey, Patrick Coyle, Matthew Quinlan, Patrick Hartigan, Charles Cope, J. O'Mahony, William Whittaker, J. P. Lynch, Michael Larkin, Thomas Burke.
            <br/>
            Evidence was given, District Inspector White conducting the inquiry.
            <br/>
            Delia Conway, wife of the deceased, Thomas Conway, stated she was married for the last three years. They lived on very good terms. He was in his usual good health yesterday, and she was with him at devotions in the Augustinian Chapel at a quarter to eight last night. They afterwards came home, and her husband attended at the bar. She last saw him alive at half-past ten o'clock, when he came upstairs. He asked witness to have some supper, and she replied she would wait until he returned. Deceased was in a good financial position, and did a good trade. When the deceased did not return to the house up to half-past twelve witness began to get uneasy about him. She sent the assistant, Ml. Horgan, down to the Shannon Rowing Club and other places to look for him. About four o'clock witness gave up hope of her husband returning and she went to bed. Deceased was about 43 years of age.
            <br/>
            By a juror - It was the usual custom of the deceased to go for a walk after the closing of business, from halfpast ten to 11 o'clock.
            <br/>
            Michael Horgan, shop assistant, said he was eight years in the employment of the deceased. Witness was in the shop last night at a quarter to 11 o'clock with Mr. Conway. Witness reminded him as to posting a business letter, and he went out to post it. He did not see Mr. Conway alive after that. The shop was closed at 11 o'clock as usual, and about half-past 12 o'clock Mrs. Conway, who was uneasy, sent him to look for Mr. Conway. Witness failed to find him. after several inquiries, and returned towards half-past two o'clock.
            <br/>
            Michael McInerney, a fisherman, said he lived at the North Strand. Returning up the Shannon early yesterday morning after fishing he put in just below Cleeve's Factory. There were two other men with witness, and in getting out of the boat he saw the body of a man on the beach on the east side of the bridge leading to the slip or dockyard. The body was face downwards. Witness reported the matter at once to the police.
            <br/>
            District-Inspector White - Did the body appear to be suffering from any violence?
            <br/>
            Witness - No, sir.
            <br/>
            District-Inspector White - The hat was not there
            <br/>
            Witness - No, it was not. The body was fully clothed, the top coat, but there was no hat.
            <br/>
            District-Inspector White - Who found the hat, Sergeant Keating?
            <br/>
            Sergeant Keating - Sparling, I have him hear.
            <br/>
            By Mr. Larkin - There was no mud on the back of the clothing of the deceased. The bridge was the next one to Barrington's Bank.
            <br/>
            To a juror - There is no chain protection. Full tide was at 12.22. There were over 19 feet of water there. It was very windy. It was very windy between 11 and 12 last night.
            <br/>
            Mr. Casey said the place was a dangerous spot.
            <br/>
            Thomas Sparling said he lived at 28, Patrick street. Witness found the hat (produced) in front of Mr. Lee's gate, at ten mintues past eight o'clock. He found it on one of the metal pillars. Witness did not know of the occurence.
            <br/>
            By a juror - There was dirt on the leaf.
            <br/>
            District Inspector White said the hat did not appear to have been in the water. The wind could have blown it up. Where the hat was got was about two hundred yards from where the body was found lying.
            <br/>
            Dr. T. K. Mulcahy said he examined the body. There were no marks of violence, save one dent in the forehead. In witness's opinion that occurred after death. Death was due to drowning - asphyxiation, the cause of drowning.
            <br/>
            By a juror - The dent would not require much force. The action of the water, the drop from the bank, or a struggle, if he struggled, against drowning might have caused the dent.
            <br/>
            District Inspector White said that was all the evidence. Two policement saw him at two minutes to 11, and he was alright then. As to the stealing of any property of the deceased, that report was done away by the fact that his watch and chain were in the house.
            <br/>
            This concluded the evidence, and the jury after a short deliberation found:- "That the deceased, Thomas Conway, was found in the River Shannon on the night of 17th February instant ; that we have no evidence to show how he got into the water, but we believe it was accidental. And we further tender to Mrs. Conway and family our deep sympathy in her bereavement."
            <br/>
            Mr. Clancy said attention should be directed to the condition of the bridges leading to Barrington's Bank. One of them was a regular death-trap, in a rotten condition, and without any protection.
            <br/>
            The Coroner said he thought the Corporation had no control over the bridges.
            <br/>
            Mr. Casey said he agreed with Mr. Clancy. The wonder to him was that more people or children were not drowned there. It was a miracle how they escaped, particularly with regard to the first bridge. He saved three children there some time ago.
            <br/>
            The proceedings ended.
