4 TEXT SAD DROWNING FATALITY IN THE CITY
5 CONT 
5 CONT A very painful feeling was caused in city circles yesterday morning, whe
5 CONC n it become known that Mr. Thomas Conway, licensed vintner, George stree
5 CONC t, had accidentally lost his life by drowning. Mr. Conway, who was in hi
5 CONC s 43rd year, was in his usual health on Thursday, attended to business
5 CONC , and left his house during the night to post a letter; then, accordin
5 CONC g to his usual practice, intending to take a walk before retiring to res
5 CONC t. He was seen passing in the direction of Wellesley Bridge some few min
5 CONC utes before 11 o'clock, and that appears to be the last time he was see
5 CONC n alive. He was then perfectly cool and collected. Yesterday morning som
5 CONC e fishermen getting ashore at the North Strand discovered him lying fac
5 CONC e downwards on the beach near the small bridge leading to Barrington's b
5 CONC ank, and the occurrence being reported to the Thomondgate police, the re
5 CONC mains were recovered and conveyed to the residence of the lamented decea
5 CONC sed. Mr. Conway, as stated was in the prime of life. He was a native o
5 CONC f the country, having been born at Boherlode, near Cahercornlish, but h
5 CONC e had been at business in the city for several years back. Personally, h
5 CONC e was a great favourite, courteous and obliging on all occasions. Ther
5 CONC e is, as evidenced at the inquiry, great sympathy with his widow and rel
5 CONC atives, and the sad end of the deceased caused quite a gloom among a lar
5 CONC ge circle of the friends and acquaintances of Mr. Conway.
5 CONT 
5 CONT Inquest
5 CONT Mr. James F. Barry, J.P., City Coroner, held an inquest at three o'clock
5 CONC , at the residence of the deceased, as to the cause of death.
5 CONT The following were the jury - George Clancy (foreman), William Savin, Jo
5 CONC hn Casey, Patrick Coyle, Matthew Quinlan, Patrick Hartigan, Charles Cope
5 CONC , J. O'Mahony, William Whittaker, J. P. Lynch, Michael Larkin, Thomas Bu
5 CONC rke.
5 CONT Evidence was given, District Inspector White conducting the inquiry.
5 CONT Delia Conway, wife of the deceased, Thomas Conway, stated she was marrie
5 CONC d for the last three years. They lived on very good terms. He was in hi
5 CONC s usual good health yesterday, and she was with him at devotions in th
5 CONC e Augustinian Chapel at a quarter to eight last night. They afterwards c
5 CONC ame home, and her husband attended at the bar. She last saw him alive a
5 CONC t half-past ten o'clock, when he came upstairs. He asked witness to hav
5 CONC e some supper, and she replied she would wait until he returned. Decease
5 CONC d was in a good financial position, and did a good trade. When the decea
5 CONC sed did not return to the house up to half-past twelve witness began t
5 CONC o get uneasy about him. She sent the assistant, Ml. Horgan, down to th
5 CONC e Shannon Rowing Club and other places to look for him. About four o'clo
5 CONC ck witness gave up hope of her husband returning and she went to bed. De
5 CONC ceased was about 43 years of age.
5 CONT By a juror - It was the usual custom of the deceased to go for a walk af
5 CONC ter the closing of business, from halfpast ten to 11 o'clock.
5 CONT Michael Horgan, shop assistant, said he was eight years in the employmen
5 CONC t of the deceased. Witness was in the shop last night at a quarter to 1
5 CONC 1 o'clock with Mr. Conway. Witness reminded him as to posting a busines
5 CONC s letter, and he went out to post it. He did not see Mr. Conway alive af
5 CONC ter that. The shop was closed at 11 o'clock as usual, and about half-pas
5 CONC t 12 o'clock Mrs. Conway, who was uneasy, sent him to look for Mr. Conwa
5 CONC y. Witness failed to find him. after several inquiries, and returned tow
5 CONC ards half-past two o'clock.
5 CONT Michael McInerney, a fisherman, said he lived at the North Strand. Retur
5 CONC ning up the Shannon early yesterday morning after fishing he put in jus
5 CONC t below Cleeve's Factory. There were two other men with witness, and i
5 CONC n getting out of the boat he saw the body of a man on the beach on the e
5 CONC ast side of the bridge leading to the slip or dockyard. The body was fac
5 CONC e downwards. Witness reported the matter at once to the police.
5 CONT District-Inspector White - Did the body appear to be suffering from an
5 CONC y violence?
5 CONT Witness - No, sir.
5 CONT District-Inspector White - The hat was not there
5 CONT Witness - No, it was not. The body was fully clothed, the top coat, bu
5 CONC t there was no hat.
5 CONT District-Inspector White - Who found the hat, Sergeant Keating?
5 CONT Sergeant Keating - Sparling, I have him hear.
5 CONT By Mr. Larkin - There was no mud on the back of the clothing of the dece
5 CONC ased. The bridge was the next one to Barrington's Bank.
5 CONT To a juror - There is no chain protection. Full tide was at 12.22. Ther
5 CONC e were over 19 feet of water there. It was very windy. It was very wind
5 CONC y between 11 and 12 last night.
5 CONT Mr. Casey said the place was a dangerous spot.
5 CONT Thomas Sparling said he lived at 28, Patrick street. Witness found the h
5 CONC at (produced) in front of Mr. Lee's gate, at ten mintues past eight o'cl
5 CONC ock. He found it on one of the metal pillars. Witness did not know of th
5 CONC e occurence.
5 CONT By a juror - There was dirt on the leaf.
5 CONT District Inspector White said the hat did not appear to have been in th
5 CONC e water. The wind could have blown it up. Where the hat was got was abou
5 CONC t two hundred yards from where the body was found lying.
5 CONT Dr. T. K. Mulcahy said he examined the body. There were no marks of viol
5 CONC ence, save one dent in the forehead. In witness's opinion that occurre
5 CONC d after death. Death was due to drowning - asphyxiation, the cause of dr
5 CONC owning.
5 CONT By a juror - The dent would not require much force. The action of the wa
5 CONC ter, the drop from the bank, or a struggle, if he struggled, against dro
5 CONC wning might have caused the dent.
5 CONT District Inspector White said that was all the evidence. Two policemen
5 CONC t saw him at two minutes to 11, and he was alright then. As to the steal
5 CONC ing of any property of the deceased, that report was done away by the fa
5 CONC ct that his watch and chain were in the house.
5 CONT This concluded the evidence, and the jury after a short deliberation fou
5 CONC nd:- "That the deceased, Thomas Conway, was found in the River Shannon o
5 CONC n the night of 17th February instant ; that we have no evidence to sho
5 CONC w how he got into the water, but we believe it was accidental. And we fu
5 CONC rther tender to Mrs. Conway and family our deep sympathy in her bereavem
5 CONC ent."
5 CONT Mr. Clancy said attention should be directed to the condition of the bri
5 CONC dges leading to Barrington's Bank. One of them was a regular death-trap
5 CONC , in a rotten condition, and without any protection.

5 CONT 
5 CONT A sad case of suicide is reported from near Fedamore. It appears that Mr
5 CONC . Patrick Conway, a respectable farmer, residing near that place, was i
5 CONC n Limerick on Tuesday and returned home in his usual health and spirits
5 CONC . He retired to bed at the customary early hour, but got up about half-p
5 CONC ast ten p.m., telling his wife that he wanted to see a sick cow. His wif
5 CONC e suggested to him to send the servant boy, but he decided on going hims
5 CONC elf. A considerable time elapsed, and as Mr. Conway did not return, hi
5 CONC s wife thought the cow required attention, and accordingly asked the bo
5 CONC y to go and give assistance. On proceeding to the cow-house he found Mr
5 CONC . Conway was not there, but on searching further discovered his body han
5 CONC ging from a rafter in another outhouse. He was suspended by the reins o
5 CONC f a horse. No motive can be assigned for the rash deed, and great sympat
5 CONC hy is felt for Mr. Conway's wife and relatives in their affliction.

5 CONT cumbed on that morning to injuries
5 CONT sustained by being knocked down by a
5 CONT car
5 CONT Supt. Cooney intimated that he did not
5 CONT intend to give any evidence other than
5 CONT evidence of identification and medical
5 CONT evidence, as papers were being sent to
5 CONT the Attorney-General for his instructions.
5 CONT 
5 CONT WIFE'S EVIDENCE
5 CONT Mrs. Christina Case, wife of thes de-
5 CONT ceased, giving evidence of identification,
5 CONT stated her husband was a farmer, and
5 CONT was 50 years of age. On Wednesday last
5 CONT the deceased left the house and went in
5 CONT the direction of Patrickswell, carrying a
5 CONT barrel of water. When he returned he
5 CONT remained indoors until 5.30 p.m., when
5 CONT he went out on a bicycle to Patrickswell
5 CONT to feed the caves at Faha, where he had

5 CONT tion of the face and legs. He was suffer-
5 CONT ing from fracture of thebase of the skull,

0 @N0212@ NOTE Hannie's mother's name is specified as Johannie Keane in her deat
1 CONC h record and not Bridget Hannon as we would expect given that she was th
1 CONC e daughter of Thomas Conway and Bridget Hannan. The other details in th
1 CONC e record match what we believe to be true about Hannie. Specifically th
1 CONC e address exactly matches that on Jeremiah's death record and the Ambros
1 CONC es' entry in the 1930 census.
1 CONT 
1 CONT There is a record of Hannie (recorded as "Hanora"), her sister Nora an
1 CONC d her son Keane travelling from Ireland to New York in 1897. Keane gav
1 CONC e "Carnane, Co. Limerick" as the residence from which he was travelling
1 CONC . There is also a record of Nora Conway travelling from Carnane to 11 Fl
1 CONC oyd St in 1898, which the record states is her sister's address. 11 Floy
1 CONC d St is where Jeremiah and Hannie were living in the 1900 Census.
1 CONT 
1 CONT This evidence strongly supports that Hannie (or Johannie) Conway from Ca
1 CONC rnane in my family tree (daughter of Thomas Conway and Bridget Hannan) w
1 CONC as Jeremiah Ambrose's wife. If that is the  case then Johannie Conway'
1 CONC s mother's name was not Johannie Keane as stated in the death record.

0 @N0223@ NOTE SAD DROWNING FATALITY IN THE CITY
1 CONT 
1 CONT A very painful feeling was caused in city circles yesterday morning, whe
1 CONC n it become known that Mr. Thomas Conway, licensed vintner, George stree
1 CONC t, had accidentally lost his life by drowning. Mr. Conway, who was in hi
1 CONC s 43rd year, was in his usual health on Thursday, attended to business
1 CONC , and left his house during the night to post a letter; then, accordin
1 CONC g to his usual practice, intending to take a walk before retiring to res
1 CONC t. He was seen passing in the direction of Wellesley Bridge some few min
1 CONC utes before 11 o'clock, and that appears to be the last time he was see
1 CONC n alive. He was then perfectly cool and collected. Yesterday morning som
1 CONC e fishermen getting ashore at the North Strand discovered him lying fac
1 CONC e downwards on the beach near the small bridge leading to Barrington's b
1 CONC ank, and the occurrence being reported to the Thomondgate police, the re
1 CONC mains were recovered and conveyed to the residence of the lamented decea
1 CONC sed. Mr. Conway, as stated was in the prime of life. He was a native o
1 CONC f the country, having been born at Boherlode, near Cahercornlish, but h
1 CONC e had been at business in the city for several years back. Personally, h
1 CONC e was a great favourite, courteous and obliging on all occasions. Ther
1 CONC e is, as evidenced at the inquiry, great sympathy with his widow and rel
1 CONC atives, and the sad end of the deceased caused quite a gloom among a lar
1 CONC ge circle of the friends and acquaintances of Mr. Conway.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Inquest
1 CONT Mr. James F. Barry, J.P., City Coroner, held an inquest at three o'clock
1 CONC , at the residence of the deceased, as to the cause of death.
1 CONT The following were the jury - George Clancy (foreman), William Savin, Jo
1 CONC hn Casey, Patrick Coyle, Matthew Quinlan, Patrick Hartigan, Charles Cope
1 CONC , J. O'Mahony, William Whittaker, J. P. Lynch, Michael Larkin, Thomas Bu
1 CONC rke.
1 CONT Evidence was given, District Inspector White conducting the inquiry.
1 CONT Delia Conway, wife of the deceased, Thomas Conway, stated she was marrie
1 CONC d for the last three years. They lived on very good terms. He was in hi
1 CONC s usual good health yesterday, and she was with him at devotions in th
1 CONC e Augustinian Chapel at a quarter to eight last night. They afterwards c
1 CONC ame home, and her husband attended at the bar. She last saw him alive a
1 CONC t half-past ten o'clock, when he came upstairs. He asked witness to hav
1 CONC e some supper, and she replied she would wait until he returned. Decease
1 CONC d was in a good financial position, and did a good trade. When the decea
1 CONC sed did not return to the house up to half-past twelve witness began t
1 CONC o get uneasy about him. She sent the assistant, Ml. Horgan, down to th
1 CONC e Shannon Rowing Club and other places to look for him. About four o'clo
1 CONC ck witness gave up hope of her husband returning and she went to bed. De
1 CONC ceased was about 43 years of age.
1 CONT By a juror - It was the usual custom of the deceased to go for a walk af
1 CONC ter the closing of business, from halfpast ten to 11 o'clock.
1 CONT Michael Horgan, shop assistant, said he was eight years in the employmen
1 CONC t of the deceased. Witness was in the shop last night at a quarter to 1
1 CONC 1 o'clock with Mr. Conway. Witness reminded him as to posting a busines
1 CONC s letter, and he went out to post it. He did not see Mr. Conway alive af
1 CONC ter that. The shop was closed at 11 o'clock as usual, and about half-pas
1 CONC t 12 o'clock Mrs. Conway, who was uneasy, sent him to look for Mr. Conwa
1 CONC y. Witness failed to find him. after several inquiries, and returned tow
1 CONC ards half-past two o'clock.
1 CONT Michael McInerney, a fisherman, said he lived at the North Strand. Retur
1 CONC ning up the Shannon early yesterday morning after fishing he put in jus
1 CONC t below Cleeve's Factory. There were two other men with witness, and i
1 CONC n getting out of the boat he saw the body of a man on the beach on the e
1 CONC ast side of the bridge leading to the slip or dockyard. The body was fac
1 CONC e downwards. Witness reported the matter at once to the police.
1 CONT District-Inspector White - Did the body appear to be suffering from an
1 CONC y violence?
1 CONT Witness - No, sir.
1 CONT District-Inspector White - The hat was not there
1 CONT Witness - No, it was not. The body was fully clothed, the top coat, bu
1 CONC t there was no hat.
1 CONT District-Inspector White - Who found the hat, Sergeant Keating?
1 CONT Sergeant Keating - Sparling, I have him hear.
1 CONT By Mr. Larkin - There was no mud on the back of the clothing of the dece
1 CONC ased. The bridge was the next one to Barrington's Bank.
1 CONT To a juror - There is no chain protection. Full tide was at 12.22. Ther
1 CONC e were over 19 feet of water there. It was very windy. It was very wind
1 CONC y between 11 and 12 last night.
1 CONT Mr. Casey said the place was a dangerous spot.
1 CONT Thomas Sparling said he lived at 28, Patrick street. Witness found the h
1 CONC at (produced) in front of Mr. Lee's gate, at ten mintues past eight o'cl
1 CONC ock. He found it on one of the metal pillars. Witness did not know of th
1 CONC e occurence.
1 CONT By a juror - There was dirt on the leaf.
1 CONT District Inspector White said the hat did not appear to have been in th
1 CONC e water. The wind could have blown it up. Where the hat was got was abou
1 CONC t two hundred yards from where the body was found lying.
1 CONT Dr. T. K. Mulcahy said he examined the body. There were no marks of viol
1 CONC ence, save one dent in the forehead. In witness's opinion that occurre
1 CONC d after death. Death was due to drowning - asphyxiation, the cause of dr
1 CONC owning.
1 CONT By a juror - The dent would not require much force. The action of the wa
1 CONC ter, the drop from the bank, or a struggle, if he struggled, against dro
1 CONC wning might have caused the dent.
1 CONT District Inspector White said that was all the evidence. Two policemen
1 CONC t saw him at two minutes to 11, and he was alright then. As to the steal
1 CONC ing of any property of the deceased, that report was done away by the fa
1 CONC ct that his watch and chain were in the house.
1 CONT This concluded the evidence, and the jury after a short deliberation fou
1 CONC nd:- "That the deceased, Thomas Conway, was found in the River Shannon o
1 CONC n the night of 17th February instant ; that we have no evidence to sho
1 CONC w how he got into the water, but we believe it was accidental. And we fu
1 CONC rther tender to Mrs. Conway and family our deep sympathy in her bereavem
1 CONC ent."
1 CONT Mr. Clancy said attention should be directed to the condition of the bri
1 CONC dges leading to Barrington's Bank. One of them was a regular death-trap
1 CONC , in a rotten condition, and without any protection.
1 CONT The Coroner said he thought the Corporation had no control over the brid
1 CONC ges.
1 CONT Mr. Casey said he agreed with Mr. Clancy. The wonder to him was that mor
1 CONC e people or children were not drowned there. It was a miracle how they e
1 CONC scaped, particularly with regard to the first bridge. He saved three chi
1 CONC ldren there some time ago.
1 CONT The proceedings ended.

1 CONT 
1 CONT A sad case of suicide is reported from near Fedamore. It appears that Mr
1 CONC . Patrick Conway, a respectable farmer, residing near that place, was i
1 CONC n Limerick on Tuesday and returned home in his usual health and spirits
1 CONC . He retired to bed at the customary early hour, but got up about half-p
1 CONC ast ten p.m., telling his wife that he wanted to see a sick cow. His wif
1 CONC e suggested to him to send the servant boy, but he decided on going hims
1 CONC elf. A considerable time elapsed, and as Mr. Conway did not return, hi
1 CONC s wife thought the cow required attention, and accordingly asked the bo
1 CONC y to go and give assistance. On proceeding to the cow-house he found Mr
1 CONC . Conway was not there, but on searching further discovered his body han
1 CONC ging from a rafter in another outhouse. He was suspended by the reins o
1 CONC f a horse. No motive can be assigned for the rash deed, and great sympat
1 CONC hy is felt for Mr. Conway's wife and relatives in their affliction.

1 CONT History of NLI's Catholic Parish Registers 
1 CONT "In the 1950s and early 1960s, the National Library of Ireland carried o
1 CONC ut a project to microfilm the surviving Catholic parish registers of th
1 CONC e entire island. Out of 1153 sets of registers, this project covered 106
1 CONC 6. Among the parishes whose records it does not include are: Rathlin Isl
1 CONC and (Co. Antrim), Crossgar (Co. Down); Clonfert, Fahy, Clonbern (Co. Gal
1 CONC way); Killorglin (Co. Kerry); Kilmeena (Co. Mayo); Rathcore & Rathmolyo
1 CONC n (Co, Meath); and the Dublin city and county parishes of Clontarf, Naul
1 CONC , Sandyford, and Santry. Almost all of these appear to have registers ea
1 CONC rlier than 1880 in local custody. In addition, the parishes of St John'

1 CONT           In order for you to be able to find records of your ancestor
1 CONC s online
1 CONT           someone first has to read the original handwritten records (or
1 CONT           photographs of the records) and type up the information on a c

1 CONT           This process is called <em>indexing</em>. There are then two f
1 CONC ormats
1 CONT           in which you can get the record information: <em>Indexes</em
1 CONC > which
1 CONT           have information copied from the original record and <em>image
1 CONC s</em>
1 CONT           (photographs) of the original record. An <em>index</em> will
1 CONT           typically have a subset of the information that can be found i

0 @N0529@ NOTE Valuation Office books 1824-1856
1 CONT The printed volumes of the Primary (or Griffith’s) Valuation, the recor
1 CONC d of Ireland’s first comprehensive property tax, have been available onl
1 CONC ine for many years now, and are a crucial part of the genealogical infra
1 CONC structure for the mid-nineteenth century. But the records which underli
1 CONC e and inform the printed valuation have never been digitised until now
1 CONC , and they contain more information about households and landholding tha
1 CONC n can be found in the printed version.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The valuation of Ireland was made for the purpose of levying tax on prop
1 CONC erty. The initial work of capturing information on every piece of proper
1 CONC ty in the country took place between 1830 and the mid-1860s, and the arc
1 CONC hives of this work are held by the National Archives. Since that time, t
1 CONC he valuation has been continuously revised and updated, and the revisio
1 CONC n documents are held by the Valuation Office. In general, archives relat
1 CONC ing to counties now in Northern Ireland are held by the Public Record Of
1 CONC fice of Northern Ireland in Belfast, although some are in the National A
1 CONC rchives. The work of valuation created a large collection of archives, w
1 CONC hich are now useful for researchers seeking information on a wide rang
1 CONC e of subjects, from family history to academic studies. These document
1 CONC s cover the entire country and, while the work was complex and technical
1 CONC , they were made according to a standard method and provide informatio
1 CONC n about families and society at a period when few other sources are exta
1 CONC nt.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The valuation work was carried out by professional valuators, assisted b
1 CONC y other staff, who worked their way through the country, county by count
1 CONC y, beginning in the north. The date of the work in each county varies. T
1 CONC hey recorded the information needed in Field Books, House Books and othe
1 CONC r documents. The work in the field was undertaken first, then the offic
1 CONC e work and, following an appeal process, the valuation was finalised.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Townland Valuation
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Townland Valuation was the first valuation and it took place under A
1 CONC cts passed between 1826 and 1836. The objective was to create a valuatio
1 CONC n of the entire country in counties, baronies, parishes and townlands. I
1 CONC ndividual occupiers were not named unless they held a house that was val
1 CONC ued at more than £5 after 1836, or £3 before that date. Information on t
1 CONC he land was collected, but did not relate to individual farms. Twenty-si
1 CONC x counties were valued in this manner before the system was changed.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Tenement Valuation
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Tenement Valuation was introduced in a piecemeal fashion and, in th
1 CONC e beginning, it overlapped with the continuation of the Townland Valuati
1 CONC on. The first Tenement Act was in 1846, following partial measures intro
1 CONC duced in 1844, and only covered counties not valued by the Townland Valu
1 CONC ation (Cork, Dublin, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford). The Tene
1 CONC ment Valuation was extended to the entire country with the 1852 Act. Und
1 CONC er the Tenement Valuation, every individual tenement or holding was reco
1 CONC rded, including the names of the occupiers, and the documents contain la
1 CONC rge numbers of names of householders. The field work and office work too
1 CONC k place in the same manner as in the Townland Valuation, and the draft v
1 CONC aluation prepared for appeals was published as the Primary Valuation, o
1 CONC r Griffith’s Valuation. Following the appeals, the valuation was finall
1 CONC y settled and recorded in the ‘cancelled books’ now held by the Valuatio
1 CONC n Office.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT There are four distinct kinds of books involved:
1 CONT 
1 CONT Field Books - The Field Books of the Valuation Office are manuscript boo
1 CONC ks that record the information required for the valuation of agricultura
1 CONC l land. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT House Books - The House Books of the Valuation Office are manuscript boo
1 CONC ks in which information on houses and buildings is recorded. The books i
1 CONC nclude houses and buildings situated in rural areas and in cities, town
1 CONC s and villages. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Tenure Books - The Valuation Office Tenure books are a series of manuscr
1 CONC ipt notebooks in which information required for the Tenement Valuation w
1 CONC as compiled. The Tenure Books are also known as Perambulation Books, a
1 CONC s the staff ‘perambulated’ or walked around the boundaries of the teneme
1 CONC nts.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Quarto Books - The Valuation Office Quarto Books are a series of manuscr
1 CONC ipt books relating to the valuation of houses and buildings in towns. Th
1 CONC e Quarto Books are found in all counties except Leitrim and Sligo, and i
1 CONC n some counties only a small number of books survive.
1 CONT 
1 CONT These records contain over 2 million names. They provide a comprehensiv
1 CONC e assessment of the rental value of Irish lands and property from the mi
1 CONC d-1820s to the mid-1850s. The books reveal where and when individuals re
1 CONC nted or owned property and provide rare glimpses of life in pre-famine I
1 CONC reland.

0 @N0532@ NOTE From the Introduction of Vol. 1, December 1979:
1 CONT 
1 CONT "The Old Limerick Society was founded in November, 1943, with high hope
1 CONC s and ambitions. The aims of the Society were:
1 CONT 
1 CONT 1. To promote the study of the history and antiquities of Limerick.
1 CONT 2. To acquire and conserve local documents, books, plans, etc.
1 CONT 3. To create and foster an interest in everything pertaining to Old Lime
1 CONC rick, and thereby help to help to cultivate a better civic spirit.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Society also worked to preserve local monuments, buildings, document
1 CONC s, legends, ballads, etc.- which were in danger of being lost - and to r
1 CONC ecord and maintain sites of historic interest.
1 CONT In December 1946 the Society produced its first, and only, journal. Thi
1 CONC s magazine made a valuable contribution to the study of Limerick's histo
1 CONC ry. The journal contained five articles, a book review and an account o
1 CONC f the proceedings of the Society, which included talks during the winte
1 CONC r sessions and summer visits to historic places.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Society continued in existence for a few more years but eventually p
1 CONC etered out in 1953. Its dissolution was a serious loss to the cultural l
1 CONC ife of Limerick. Since that time much good work has been done by the Tho
1 CONC mond Archaeological Society, the local press and inidividuals in the pro
1 CONC motion of he study of local history.
1 CONT 
1 CONT This journal and the re-formed Old Limerick Society wish to take up, con
1 CONC tinue and expand on the work of the 1940s group. We hope our readers wil
1 CONC l find an immediate sense of the past and its people in these pages. W
1 CONC e hope they will find this sense in pictures and articales on the buildi
1 CONC ngs, streets and waterways of the city, on the fields and farms of the c
1 CONC ountry - and the workers who lived and laboured on them through the cent
1 CONC uries. This journal will attempt to chart some of the real-life experien
1 CONC ces of Limerick and its people."

1 CONC n inquest touching the death of the Rev. J. Conway, C.C., Shanagolden, C
1 CONC o. Limerick, aged 48 years, whose body had been taken out of the sea a

1 CONC t the rev. gentleman went bathing with another clergyman, who was unabl
1 CONC e to render him any hassistance owing to the heavy sea, and only got ash
1 CONC ore with considerable difficulty. The Rev. Mr. Fry, Rector, with charate
1 CONC ristic pluck, swam to the assistance of the drowning clergyman, and brou
1 CONC ght him ashore, but it appeared that life was then extinct, as the mos
1 CONC t vigorous efforts at artificial respiration failed to restore conciousn

1 CONC h from drowning was returned.

1 CONC n of Rev. John Conway of Carnane and brother of another Rev. John Conway
1 CONC , was P.P. of Glenroe for five years until his death in 1931. That appea

1 CONT 
1 CONT According to the death notice of Rev. John Conway (Patrick's brother)
1 CONC ,  John Conway was P.P. of Glenroe when he died in 1931. This evidence i

1 CONT

1 CONT proved against Patrick Leo, who, under penalty of public 
1 CONT expulsion from the school, was adjudged to pay for the 
1 CONT books and upon his knees to apologize to the whole school 
1 CONT for his bad behavior. With floods of tears that bespoke

0 @N0644@ NOTE According to John Grenham [ https://www.johngrenham.com/browse/retr
1 CONC ieve_text.php?text_contentid=66 ] -
1 CONT 
1 CONT "From the 1820s to the 1840s a complex process of reform attempted to st
1 CONC andardise the basis of local taxation in Ireland. The first steps were t
1 CONC o map and fix administrative boundaries through the Ordnance Survey an
1 CONC d the associated Boundary Commission. The next step was to assess the pr
1 CONC oductive capacity of all property in the country in a thoroughly unifor
1 CONC m way. Richard Griffith, a geologist based in Dublin, became Boundary Co
1 CONC mmissioner in 1825 and Commissioner of Valuation in 1827. The results o
1 CONC f his great survey, the Primary	Valuation of Ireland, were published bet
1 CONC ween 1847 and 1864. The valuation is arranged by county, barony, Poor La
1 CONC w Union, civil parish and townland, and it lists every landholder and ev
1 CONC ery householder in Ireland. Apart from townland address and householder'
1 CONC s name, the particulars given are:
1 CONT 
1 CONT name of the person from whom the property was leased ('immediate lessor'
1 CONC );
1 CONT description of the property;
1 CONT acreage;
1 CONT valuation.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The only directly useful family information supplied is in areas wher
1 CONC e a surname was particularly common. The surveyors often adopted the tra
1 CONC ditional Irish practice of using the father's first name to distinguis
1 CONC h between individuals of the same name, so that 'John Reilly (James)' i
1 CONC s the son of James, while 'John Reilly (Michael)' is the son of Michael
1 CONC . For similar reasons, occupations are also sometimes used to tell 'Joh
1 CONC n Ryan (weaver)' from 'John Ryan (farmer)'. Copies of Griffith's Valuati
1 CONC on are widely available in major libraries and record offices, both on m
1 CONC icrofiche and in their original published form. A free online version i
1 CONC s at www.askaboutireland.ie.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT The valuation was never intended as a census substitute, and if the 185
1 CONC 1 census had survived it would have little genealogical significance. A
1 CONC s things stand, however, it gives the only detailed guide to where in Ir
1 CONC eland people lived in the middle of the nineteenth century and to what p
1 CONC roperty they occupied. In addition, a huge quantity of material was prod
1 CONC uced both before publication and in subsequent revisions, making it poss
1 CONC ible in many cases to identify occupiers before the publication date an
1 CONC d to trace living descendants of those originally listed by Griffith. (S

1 CONT 
1 CONT This could be Nora Conway, though the surname and date of birth are wron

1 CONT In August 1939 after Hannie Ambroses' death, Frannie Ambrose placed a no
1 CONC tice in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle relating to Hannie Ambroses' will. Th
1 CONC e notice addressed several people, but the wording used to address Kean
1 CONC e Ambrose suggested that it was not known if he was alive or dead, howev
1 CONC er an obituary of Hannie Ambroses' names Keane as a surviving child.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In April 1942 a World War II registration card was filled out in the nam
1 CONC e of Michael Keene Ambrose, with an address of 343 E. 26th St., Brooklyn
1 CONC , New York which is the family home of the Ambroses' in this tree. He gi
1 CONC ves Nora Dillon as a contact. His date of birth is given as 27th Augus
1 CONC t 1882. Keane Matthew Ambrose gave his date of birth as 27th August 188
1 CONC 4 on his World War I registration card in 1918.
1 CONT 
1 CONT There are no records of Michael Keene Ambrose living with the Ambrose fa
1 CONC mily as a child in the US Census.
1 CONT 
1 CONT All of the above suggests to me that Keane Matthew Ambrose went missin
1 CONC g in the 1920's, was declared legally dead, and reappeared sometime betw
1 CONC een August 1939 and April 1942 as Michael Keene Ambrose.
1 CONT

1 CONT PRIEST LOSES THE BEQUEST.
1 CONT Katie McGinty Was Very Ill When
1 CONT She Made Her Will.
1 CONT 
1 CONT It was decided by a jury in Judge H. Slover's division of the circuit co
1 CONC urt yesterday that Katie McGinty was too ill to know what she was doin
1 CONC g when she made her will bequeathing all of her property to the Rev. A
1 CONC . G. Clohessy, pastor of St. Joseph's church, Nineteenth and Harrison st
1 CONC reets, and that the will should be set aside and the property given to h
1 CONC er blood relations.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Miss McGinty served as housekeeper for Father Clohessy for fourteen cons
1 CONC ecutive years prior to the illness, which, on January 26, 1907, caused h
1 CONC er death. She was paid $2.50 a week, and out of this she saved, in the f
1 CONC ourteen years,, $1,128. The money was kept in the Fidelity Trust Company
1 CONC . A few days before her death in St. Margaret's hospital, she called Fat
1 CONC her Cloheesy in and asked him to accept the money. He refused to accep
1 CONC t it. Then she made a will, in his presence, leaving everything to him
1 CONC , after he should expend $25 for her funeral and gravestone and $200 fo
1 CONC r masses to be said for her soul. The funeral was held, the headstone er
1 CONC ected and the masses were said. Then when Father Clohessy probated the w
1 CONC ill, James McGinty, a brother of the dead woman, brought the action in t
1 CONC he circuit court.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Miss McGinty left no property other than the $1,128, excepting her cloth
1 CONC ing and personal effects. The residue of the estate will be divided amon
1 CONC g James, Patrick and Dennis McGinty, three brothers in Kansas City, an
1 CONC d seven nephews and nieces in St. Louis.

1 CONT PRIEST ENTITLED TO LEGACY.
1 CONT Will of Katie McGinty is Held Valid
1 CONT by a Jury.
1 CONT 
1 CONT At the second trial of the suit of the brothers of Katie McGinty to brea
1 CONC k her will, by which she gave all of her property to Father Andrew G. Cl
1 CONC ohessy of St. Joseph's church, the jury last evening found that the wil
1 CONC l was valid and that the priest is entitled to the money. The verdict i
1 CONC n the first trial, three months ago, was in favor of the brothers. The s
1 CONC econd trial was in Judge E. E. Porterfield's division of the circuit cou
1 CONC rt.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Katie McGinty was employed for fourteen years prior to her death in St
1 CONC . Margaret's hospital in January, 1907, as a domestic in the parish hous
1 CONC e at 1007 East Nineteenth street. She began service at $2 a week, was ad
1 CONC vanced to $6, and out of her wages saved $1,161. The day before her deat
1 CONC h she summoned to her bedside Father Clohessy, for whom she had worked t
1 CONC he many years, and asked him to accept her earnings. He refused. Later
1 CONC , while he was absent, she drew up a will, giving it all to him.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The priest had spent all but $200 of the $1,161 before the suit was brou
1 CONC ght by Jim McGinty and Patrick McGinty and the children of George and Be
1 CONC rnard McGinty, Katie's brothers. He devoted $400 to a funeral, $75 fo
1 CONC r a lot in St. Mary's cemetery, $260 for the gravestone and $200 gave t
1 CONC o other priests for the saying of mass for the repose of her soul.

1 CONT 
1 CONT There is also a record of Patrick Conway in the same family being baptis
1 CONC ed on 22 Jun 1836.
1 CONT 
1 CONT St. John's parish is in Limerick city. The above can be verified as bapt
1 CONC isms of children of John Conway and Margaret Hall from the parish record
1 CONC s online (there are also a few baptisms of children of John Conway and M
1 CONC argaret Hall from 1823 onwards in the neighbouring parish of St. Mary, t
1 CONC hough Thomas is not apparent).
1 CONT 
1 CONT Mary Looby's information also has it that came from Pallas Grean, whic
1 CONC h is about 20 kilometers from St. John's parish. Normally baptisms are p
1 CONC erformed in the parish in which the family lives, so the information abo
1 CONC ut the baptisms may be incorrect.
1 CONT 
1 CONT It is possible that Thomas Conway (with or without the rest of the famil
1 CONC y) moved to Pallas Grean when he was a teenager, or later or that the fa
1 CONC mily lived in Pallas Grean but for some reason had their children baptis
1 CONC ed in the city.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Alternatively it could be that someone found that the baptism records i
1 CONC n St. John's parish matched some of the information on the family and in
1 CONC correctly concluded that those records refer to people in this family tr
1 CONC ee. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Without knowing why those baptisms are thought to apply to our family i
1 CONC t is difficult to know if the information is correct or not. Until I fin
1 CONC d out that those records should apply, I shall err on the side of cautio
1 CONC n leave out the children for which there is no other evidence of a conne
1 CONC ction to the family. By the same token I will also exclude Margaret Hall

1 CONC nd the Mediterranean. Exceptions to this are vessels that originated out
1 CONC side of these areas but then picked up passengers in European or Mediter

1 CONC nal destination of the ship. In addition, the names found in the index a
1 CONC re linked to actual images of the passenger lists, copied from The Natio
1 CONC nal Archives (TNA) collection series BT26.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The passenger lists date from 1878 to 1888 and 1890 to 1960. However, ma
1 CONC ny of the pre-1890 lists were irregularly destroyed by the Board of Trad
1 CONC e in 1900. Therefore, there are not many lists included in this databas
1 CONC e that date from these earlier years.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Separate lists were kept for British (and Commonwealth) passengers and A
1 CONC lien passengers. In addition, there was a variety of form types used thr
1 CONC oughout the years. These differences in forms may result in a variety o
1 CONC f information recorded for different passengers.
1 CONT

1 CONT Between 1890 and 1920, among the highest tonnage of ships were leaving B
1 CONC ritish ports bound for North America. Many passengers were emigrants fro
1 CONC m Britain, Ireland and Europe. European emigrants bound for America ente
1 CONC red the United Kingdom because travelling steerage was less expensive fr
1 CONC om a British port than from a port in Europe. The shipping companies imp
1 CONC osed restrictions on passengers registering; passengers had to have Brit

1 CONT 
1 CONT Esther appears inthe 1925 New York state census as Esther Ambrose livin
1 CONC g with her parents. She must have married some time after the census wa
1 CONC s taken in 1925.
1 CONT 
1 CONT There is a record of the marriage of Esther L Ambrose to Harry J Lehr i
1 CONC n Brookly in 1926.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In the 1930 census there is a record of Harry J Lehr and his wife Elizab
1 CONC eth L who were four years married in 1930. Elizabeth's age in the censu
1 CONC s is approximately what Esther's would have been, and her birth place (N
1 CONC ew York) and the birth places of her parents (both from Ireland) match E
1 CONC sther's exactly.
1 CONT 
1 CONT It's possible that the enumerator mistakenly recorded Esther's name as E
1 CONC lizabeth. Also the information that Harry's surname was Sehc may have ar
1 CONC isen from an incorrect transcription of Lehr, the names being similar wh

0 @N0931@ NOTE Since 1 July 1837, civil registration of births has been a legal re
1 CONC quirement of all citizens of England and Wales. In order to find your an
1 CONC cestor’s born before 1837, it is best to search the parish registers. Bi
1 CONC rth records are a key source to creating your family tree.
1 CONT 
1 CONT All the civil birth records on Findmypast are name-indexed, which make
1 CONC s finding your ancestors so much simpler. The old birth indexes were pag
1 CONC e-indexed rather than name-indexed, meaning that to find your ancestor
1 CONC s you had to check through pages of records and see if your ancestor wa
1 CONC s somewhere on the image. The original documents are held by the Genera
1 CONC l Register Office (GRO). By using the information found within this inde
1 CONC x, you can request the original document of your ancestor’s birth. You w
1 CONC ill need to register with the GRO site and pay a small fee.

1 CONC ore 1984, you can also view the original index. The birth, marriage an

1 CONT 
1 CONT Country wide civil registration of births, marriages and deaths commence
1 CONC d on 1 July 1837 in England and Wales. Registration took place at loca
1 CONC l civil registrars who in turn reported to the Registrar General at th
1 CONC e General Register Office (GRO) in London. This national index to vita
1 CONC l records is an essential source of genealogical information for famil
1 CONC y historians.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Since the original birth, marriage and death registers are not open to t
1 CONC he public, access to the information on one of these certificates is don
1 CONC e by first searching the national birth, marriage and death indexes, tha
1 CONC t have been created by the GRO for this purpose. The indexes for the thr
1 CONC ee events are divided into volumes by year following which entries are l
1 CONC isted alphabetically. Once an entry in one of the indexes is found, yo
1 CONC u are then able to use that information to order of copy of a death, mar
1 CONC riage or birth certificate from the GRO. Information that can be obtaine
1 CONC d from the birth index includes:
1 CONT 
1 CONT     Full name of child

1 CONT     Month and year of registration

0 @N1023@ NOTE [[Hypothesis]] : 
1 CONT The wife of Thomas Foley [~1839 - 1921] and mother of Mary Ann Foley [18
1 CONC 73 - 1957] (who was married to Michael Noonan) was Mary Blackwell, not M
1 CONC ary Cusack or Amelia Blackwell. Links to evidence can be found below.
1 CONT 
1 CONT [[Evidence]] :
1 CONT [Received via Jerry Russell] :
1 CONT The information that Jerry Russell passed on to me is that the sibling
1 CONC s of Mary Ann b1873  included
1 CONT 
1 CONT Jimmy, husband of an unknown McGrath, father of Mary, Amelia and Tommy
1 CONT Bridget who married Fitzgerald, mother of Ned, Patrick, Jim, Tom, Mary a
1 CONC nd Kathleen
1 CONT Hannie  who married Lahiff
1 CONT 
1 CONT Other information that Jerry passed on is that Mary Ann's parents were a
1 CONC n unknown Foley and Mary Cusack. Mary Cusack who was the sister of Joh
1 CONC n Cusack [1831 - 1894] who was married to Ellen Anastasia Gleeson.
1 CONT 
1 CONT This information probably came from descendents of the Foley families, o
1 CONC r other relatives, and for the most part is the same as other trees tha
1 CONC t are online. As such I'm inclined to believe that the information is co
1 CONC rrect except where it conflicts with other evidence. Specifically I'm as
1 CONC suming that the names of Mary Ann's siblings are correct.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT [1901 census for Mary Ann's siblings][1] :
1 CONT The 1901 census has a Foley family in Lickadoon, Roxborough, Limerick wi
1 CONC th children whose names are James (26), Hannie (25) and Bridget (24). Th
1 CONC e father Thomas is a widower.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The names exactly match Mary Ann's known siblings. It is very likely tha
1 CONC t this family is Mary Ann's.
1 CONT 
1 CONT [Mary Ann's marriage][2] :
1 CONT There is a record of Mary Ann Foley of Lickadoon, whose father was Thoma
1 CONC s, marrying Michael Nunan of Raheen in 1895. This explains Mary Ann's ab
1 CONC scence from the Foley household in 1901 and further supports the hypothe
1 CONC sis that that household belongs to Mary Ann's family.
1 CONT 
1 CONT [Birth records of Mary Ann and her siblings][3 - 6] :
1 CONT There are records of Jimmy, Mary Ann, Hannie and Bridget being born in L
1 CONC ickadoon in the 1870s to Thomas and Mary Foley, in the same order as the
1 CONC y appear in the census (plus Mary Ann in 1873). However Mary's maiden na
1 CONC me in those records is Blackwell.
1 CONT 
1 CONT [Marriage and death of Mary Blackwell][7][8] :
1 CONT Thomas Foley and Mary Blackwell married in 1867, several years before th
1 CONC e birth of their first known child, and Mary Foley died in the year foll
1 CONC owing the birth of their last known child. The timing of her marriage an
1 CONC d death around births of their children supports the hyposthesis that Ma
1 CONC ry Blackwell was the mother of Mary Ann and her siblings.
1 CONT 
1 CONT [Jimmy's family][9 - 12] :
1 CONT James Foley of Lickadoon, son of Thomas Foley, married Margaret Lynch i
1 CONC n 1908. They had the following issue:
1 CONT 
1 CONT Mary b1909
1 CONT Thomas b1910
1 CONT Amelia b1914
1 CONT 
1 CONT Jimmy's wife's maiden name differs from Jerry's information, but the nam
1 CONC es of the children are the same which suggests that Jimmy's wife's maide
1 CONC n name was Lynch not McGrath.
1 CONT 
1 CONT This evidence supports the notion that James Foley in these records is J
1 CONC immy Foley in Jerry's information.
1 CONT 
1 CONT [Hannie's family][13] :
1 CONT Johanna Foley of Lickadoon, daughter of Thomas Foley, married John Lahif
1 CONC f in 1908.
1 CONT 
1 CONT This evidence supports the notion that the Johanna Foley in these record
1 CONC s is Hannie Foley in Jerry's information.
1 CONT 
1 CONT [Bridget's family][14 - 16] :
1 CONT Bridget Foley of Lickadoon, daughter of Thomas Foley, married Patrick Fi
1 CONC tzgerald in 1902. They had issue:
1 CONT 
1 CONT Mary b~1903
1 CONT Jim b~1905
1 CONT Tom b~1907
1 CONT Patrick b~1909
1 CONT Ned b~1910
1 CONT Kathleen b1912
1 CONT 
1 CONT These names are the same as found in Jerry's information.
1 CONT 
1 CONT This evidence supports the notion that the Bridget Foley in these record
1 CONC s is Bridget Foley in Jerry's information.
1 CONT 
1 CONT [Mary Ann's family][17 - 19] :
1 CONT Mary Ann and Michael Noonan had issue:
1 CONT 
1 CONT Mikey b~1896
1 CONT Jack b1900
1 CONT Thomas b~1901
1 CONT May b~1902
1 CONT Paddy b~1907
1 CONT Joe b~1909
1 CONT Hannie b1911
1 CONT 
1 CONT These names are also found in Jerry's information.
1 CONT 
1 CONT This evidence supports the notion that the Mary Ann Foley in these recor
1 CONC ds is Mary Ann Foley in Jerry's information.
1 CONT 
1 CONT [[Conclusions]] :
1 CONT The coincidence of the names of Mary Ann's siblings and children and th
1 CONC e names of Mary Ann's siblings' children in various birth and marriage r
1 CONC ecords with the information in Jerry's tree, and other trees online, ind
1 CONC icates that Mary Ann and her family were from Lickadoon and their fathe
1 CONC r was Thomas Foley. The birth records of Mary Ann, Jimmy , Hannie and Br
1 CONC idget show that their mother was Mary Blackwell. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT The only way that Mary Ann's mother could have been Mary Cusack or Ameli
1 CONC a Blackwell is if there was another Foley family in Lickadoon with the s
1 CONC ame first names, and with no corresponding birth, marriage or census rec
1 CONC ords.
1 CONT 
1 CONT At least one online tree has the death of Amelia Foley, born Blackwell
1 CONC , in 1907, though there is no corresponding death registration record. A
1 CONC lso Thomas Foley's census record from 1901 says that he is a widower. It
1 CONC 's possible that a woman called Amelia, possibly a relative of Thomas Fo
1 CONC ley or Mary Blackwell, helped to raise Mary Blackwell's children after M
1 CONC ary's death and was thought by some to be their mother.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Another possiblity is that Mary Blackwell was informally known as Amelia
1 CONC .
1 CONT 
1 CONT If there is a connection between Mary Cusack and the Foley family it's n
1 CONC ot clear from the evidence at hand.

1 CONT About Ireland, The Royal Irish Constabulary 1816-1921
1 CONT The Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) was created in 1816, and initially st
1 CONC affed mainly by Irish-born men. However, toward the 1900s, and especiall
1 CONC y afterwards, the RIC recruited men from countries such as England, Scot
1 CONC land, Wales, and the United States. The records of the RIC were only ind
1 CONC exed annually by the date of enlistment. Until this database was created
1 CONC , the only way to identify whether an ancestor joined the forces was a
1 CONC n extremely time-consuming search. Some people joined for a few days o
1 CONC r weeks, others stayed for years, and quite a few migrated. There are me
1 CONC ntions in the index on whether a person emigrated, died, or married. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT The original records go into greater details, showing where each man wa
1 CONC s stationed, where he had relatives, whether he got married, and if so t
1 CONC he date, illnesses, conduct, promotions, cause of death if died in the f
1 CONC orce; pensioned or retired; as well as a physical description. The inde
1 CONC x shows the name of each man, a year or birth or an age on enlistment
1 CONC ; a county of birth or a country; whether single or married, comments su
1 CONC ch as died, emigrated, etc., and the reference film number and page fo
1 CONC r fuller details. This index is an important source for Irish research
1 CONC , even if your ancestor didn't appear to have been in the RIC. He may ha
1 CONC ve enlisted for a few days or weeks and signed out. His details are stil
1 CONC l on record. This index is a work in progress. This latest update adds a
1 CONC nother 11,074 records to the previous 58,433 records.

1 CONC age project. Local community groups are trained in low-cost high-tech fi
1 CONC eld survey of historic graveyards and recording of their own oral histor
1 CONC ies. They build a multi-media online record of the historic graves in th
1 CONC eir own areas and unite to form a national resource. The project outline
1 CONC s a system and sequence which helps to co-ordinate and standardise an hi
1 CONC storic graveyard survey.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Community groups are trained to use digital cameras and smartphones to s
1 CONC urvey historic graveyards.
1 CONT Both new and old survey records are combined with locally recorded audi
1 CONC o and video stories to form a multi media record of a graveyard.
1 CONT By curating and publishing the survey records centrally the individual c
1 CONC ommunity graveyard surveys combine to form a national resource where th
1 CONC e value of each survey is compounded by its association with others.
1 CONT The website allows visitors from Ireland and across the globe to freel
1 CONC y explore and search the growing database of multimedia records and stor
1 CONC ies.
1 CONT It allows communities to self publish historic graveyard surveys and th
1 CONC e related multimedia stories.
1 CONT The surveys are being funded by a number of Local Development Partnershi
1 CONC ps through LEADER funds and are supported by Local Heritage Officers, Co
1 CONC unty Archaeologists and Local Authorities.
1 CONT People, institutions and organisations contribute to the project in thre
1 CONC e ways 1. voluntary works 2. permission 3. funding.
1 CONT We now spend a lot of time working with community groups to get fundin
1 CONC g for training surveys and uploads. And starting in April 2018 we are as
1 CONC king people who use the website to crowdfund new surveys. Every penny (e
1 CONC xcept Paypal charges) will go to new surveys.
1 CONT The website and survey methodology have been designed and built by Eacht
1 CONC ra Archaeological Projects.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The original design was by John Tierney and Maurizio Toscano, Eachtra
1 CONC ’s GIS manager, built and developed the system. Since the early design s
1 CONC tage various people have had an input into the development of the projec

1 CONC t the Tipperary Institute, and Caimin O’Brien, Department of Environmen
1 CONC t archaeologist have also had inputs into its development. Caimin O’Brie
1 CONC n encouraged us to develop the multimedia elements of the graveyard surv
1 CONC eys and this dovetailed perfectly with the hyperlocal heritage teaching
1 CONC s of Bernie Goldbach.

1 CONC , d1964 Attleboro, Massachusetts.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Thomas wrote the memoir in a notebook and relatives typed it out and cop

1 CONT 
1 CONT This transcription is from one such copy given to me by Hugh Sweeney.
0 @N1550@ NOTE Preface
1 CONT 	This typed and bound version of Thomas Hannan's autobiographical recoll
1 CONC ections differs only slightly from the handwritten version which he penn
1 CONC ed himself in a small notebook. That original version contained two dist
1 CONC inct sections -- a main narrative and a supplement written sometime afte
1 CONC r the first. This distinction has been retained in the same form in thi
1 CONC s volume.
1 CONT 	A very small amount of editing has occurred; mostly corrections in th
1 CONC e spelling of personal and place names, the addition of punctuation wher
1 CONC e it seemed appropriate, and some small grammatical adjustments.  Otherw
1 CONC ise this volume is just as it was penned in his own hand in the now some
1 CONC what tattered little notebook.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Looking Backward on Life  by Thomas Hannan
1 CONT 	My first recollections is that our family lived in a cottage not far fr
1 CONC om the Good Shepherd Convent and St. John's Hospital and St. John's Cath
1 CONC olic Church in Limerick City. I could look over a wall at the back of th
1 CONC e house by climbing up by crevices in it, and used to see the Limerick C
1 CONC ounty Prison and also an asylum for the feeble minded. There may have be
1 CONC en the County Hospital and the Artillery Barracks over that way at tha
1 CONC t time, but I did not know about that until I was over ten years of ag
1 CONC e and had been brought from Dublin to Limerick by my Uncle Tom Maloney
1 CONC , to his home in Gerald Griffin St. at that time known as Cornwallis St.
1 CONC . Gerald Griffin was an Irish man and a poet. Cornwallis was an old Engl
1 CONC ish General, so the name was changed by our fine Irish City Council.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Then next, I remember swallowing a glass marble, it had such nice color
1 CONC s, being a kid I put it in my mouth and down it went, I never found an
1 CONC y ill effects from it. Then about that time I was down the street an
1 CONC d a horse broke away from a smith's forge that was at the forge end of t
1 CONC he street, I remember women with white aprons rushing about and screamin
1 CONC g, the child is killed, but the horse said no, so he jumped over me a
1 CONC s I sat on the edge of the sidewalk. Then again I remember that I must h
1 CONC ave fallen out of bed and picked up either my father or mother and I wa
1 CONC s bawling out good. Years after I found a lump on my collar bone, it i
1 CONC s there yet so perhaps I broke it when I fell out of bed and it knit aga
1 CONC in. I do not know if my parents knew about it or not, I believe I had th
1 CONC e measles about that time.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	My next recollection is that there were several of us in a train an
1 CONC d I think it was my brother Pat, who was some years older than I, who sa
1 CONC id here is Dublin so I looked out the window as the train was coming i
1 CONC n to a great big place with a lot of tracks and a ceiling up very high a
1 CONC nd iron girders and a big clock with a white face, and as I looked at th
1 CONC at enormous clock I thought that white clock is Dublin and I tried to fi
1 CONC gure it out.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Next my father was there and we piled baggage on top of what they calle
1 CONC d a cab and a man called a jarvey drove us across a big city with a lo
1 CONC t of houses and streets and a lot of strange noises. I must have been ti
1 CONC red as I don't remember more about that arrival in Dublin. It may have b
1 CONC een in the year 1880 or 1881.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	There is a sort of blank in my memory for some time must have elapsed
1 CONC , for I remember my mother fixing up some bread and batter and a bit o
1 CONC f sweet cake as we called current raisin bread. I was brought to schoo
1 CONC l by someone, perhaps Pat or my sister Katie who was older than Pat. I r
1 CONC emember a small class, one with twenty more kids about my age, and I ha
1 CONC d a red book with short sentences and pictures in it, and I opened up m
1 CONC y bread and started eating, the teacher said I would have to wait unti
1 CONC l play time, that was years away to my mind. Somehow I must have got alo
1 CONC ng all right for I remember being in another class they called it the Gr
1 CONC een Book. No one ever asked me anything or told me anything except tha
1 CONC t my mother always had me clean and with my bread and butter going to sc
1 CONC hool. Then after a lapse of time, I don't know long as I never asked abo
1 CONC ut these things I next remember that my mother brought me nice beads gol
1 CONC den color and taught me to say the rosary.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	I had them for a great many years, where they went I don't know know. T
1 CONC hen I remember my aunt who was my father's brother's wife and lived nea
1 CONC r us, taking me to the shore of Dublin bay out by Clontarf where King Br
1 CONC ian Ború, defeated the Danes. We brought home some seaweed; it was suppo
1 CONC sed to be a cure for whatever was wrong with my mother, who had come hom
1 CONC e from the Mater Misericordiae Hospital after being there for some time
1 CONC . I was in Second Book when my mother died and she was buried in Glasnev
1 CONC in. I do not know if it was in 1882 or early 1883.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	About that time there was a secret society called the Invincibles. Ho
1 CONC w many were in it I do not really know. I have an idea that the top memb
1 CONC ers were in the United States and in some way connected with the Clan n
1 CONC a Gaels supposedly an organization got together for ways and means for f
1 CONC reeing Ireland from English Rule. There were in Dublin at that time perh
1 CONC aps twenty or more. I never found out how many. My father had a suspicio
1 CONC n of two of them from some words he heard drop from a man who worked a
1 CONC s a van driver, we call them truckers, for the O'Brien and Co.
1 CONT Mineral Water and Wine Cordials they manufactured or brewed them right t
1 CONC here in the factory in Henry Place, Dublin. I used to go there after sch
1 CONC ool nearly every afternoon end spend my time looking at the men washin
1 CONC g the bottle by machine and the men blending raisins and grapes and rasp
1 CONC berry to make the syrups which were the real foundation for the wine
1 CONC s - also saw the men working et the bottling and corking machines, als
1 CONC o up at the carpenters’ bench he was a good fellow his name was Joe Kens
1 CONC ella. He used to repair broken cases, these cases were made of wood wit
1 CONC h sections for 24 lemonade bottles, larger cases held 6 dozen bottles an
1 CONC d could be shipped by rail all over Ireland. This factory started-with t
1 CONC wo vans and during my time it had advanced in the business world that th
1 CONC e last time I visited them when I was at home in 1910, when Tom was a ba
1 CONC by, they had 10 vans, the factory was 6 times larger. I am getting awa
1 CONC y from my train of thought, About the Invincibles. Ireland at that tim
1 CONC e had a representative of the British Government taking up residence i
1 CONC n the Vice Regal Lodge in the Pheonix Park in Dublin. So a man named Bou
1 CONC rke was a secretary and companion to the Lord Lieutenant whose name wa
1 CONC s Lord Cavendish who had arrived only that week to take over his positio
1 CONC n. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	These Invincibles watched for the arrival of those two gentlemen who ha
1 CONC d come in by mail boat to Kingstown and by train to Westland Row Statio
1 CONC n in Dublin. These murderers signalled by waving a handkerchief and th
1 CONC e others were lined up along the distance from the station to the Lodg
1 CONC e in the Park in that way they didn't take any chance they might go to s
1 CONC ome other place to visit perhaps, so both got to the Vice Regal Lodge, a
1 CONC nd as the evening was fine they walked over to the road that runs throug
1 CONC h the Park not a very public place as the often used main road ran outsi
1 CONC de the Park in the same general direction.  The two friends walked up an
1 CONC d down near some shade trees which were planted in seven trees to clum
1 CONC p the murderers who were watching every move, drove up near them and sai
1 CONC d something about freeing Ireland and 5 or 6 of them attacked the two me
1 CONC n who defended themselves with their umbrellas, that Englishmen usuall
1 CONC y carry, but they
1 CONT were stabbed with a dagger or daggers and left in a sitting position aga
1 CONC inst two trees. These two trees died and there are 7 trees in every clum
1 CONC p or cluster all the way through the Park driveway except on that spot t
1 CONC here are only five trees. I was only child but I went out there one Sund
1 CONC ay on a train from the centre of the city, the place is marked with tw
1 CONC o crosses formed with white stones: These murderers were traced out an
1 CONC d arrested some found guilty and hanged, others got jail terms. One, th
1 CONC e car driver who was known to me as skin the goot, got 1 years and after
1 CONC wards I was told he got a job at the Dublin dump. One of them became a
1 CONC n informer to save his own neck, he was the leader of the Dublin gang. H
1 CONC e (Carey the informer) gave evidence and had a lot to do with their conv
1 CONC iction. The government then tried secretly to ship him out to Cape Tow
1 CONC n which is as you know in South Africa, an English possession. He was fo
1 CONC llowed even on the same ship, by an agent, his name was O'Donnell an
1 CONC d I understand was sent over by the Clan na Gael Society to find and mur
1 CONC der him or as they may have called just execution of an informer. Care
1 CONC y was shot by O'Donnell when he got a good chance of having Carey alon
1 CONC e on the ship ea it neared Cape Town. O'Donnell was of course arrested a
1 CONC t once, was tried and was hanged. I reed about his trial in the Dublin n
1 CONC ewspaper. As far as I can remember that was about the year 1883. I was a
1 CONC t school in the Marlborough St. National schools. These schools must hav
1 CONC e covered a mile square of ground. There was from 1st the infants that h
1 CONC eld several hundred children with young women teachers them five school
1 CONC s for the girls each holding a hundred each school was for a certain cla
1 CONC ss such as the Infants. A,B,C, up to First Book and then second book fro
1 CONC m N1 to N55 were as I stated, each for a book as we called them 3 book t
1 CONC o 4th book etc. Then a music gallery and drawing school and what we call
1 CONC ed manual training in this country. We called carpenter shop. The boys s
1 CONC chools were at the North side. The girls at the south side. Well about t
1 CONC hat time my Uncle Tom Maloney who had a bar-room and restaurant in Geral
1 CONC d Griffin South Limerick. He and my older brother John were salesmen o
1 CONC r as we called them Brokers. They sold wheat, oats, barley and rye and b
1 CONC utter also [sentence fragment missing] commission in the Limerick market
1 CONC s for
1 CONT the farmers all round the County of Limerick and even to Clare, the nex
1 CONC t county across the Shannon River that runs through Limerick City. My si
1 CONC ster Margaret was his housekeeper and attended to the business when th
1 CONC e men were out. I lived there years after and did the same work they did
1 CONC , but I will come to this later on.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Well, Uncle Tom came to Dublin to give evidence in a dispute which wa
1 CONC s being tried in the Four Courts which was a High court of Ireland in Du
1 CONC blin. He had to give evidence as to which class of firkin was best for b
1 CONC utter, the hand made by a cooper or one made by machinery by a lumber ya
1 CONC rd. (A firkin is a barrel used to hold butter when being brought to mark
1 CONC et and holds about 70 lbs. of butter, He took me to Limerick and I staye
1 CONC d for three months, wasn't that fine, no school to go to for all that ti
1 CONC me, it just shows how a kid's mind works, That was the first time I me
1 CONC t my Aunt Maloney. My mother's sister, also my brother John and sister M
1 CONC argaret. Well when on this pleasant visit. My Uncle liked to take me fo
1 CONC r walks and showed me the Treaty Stone where the Treaty of Peace was sig
1 CONC ned by General Sarsfield and some of his generals for the Irish and Gene
1 CONC rel Genkle for the English. The Irish with some French who were in the a
1 CONC rmy in the city, were to march out with flags flying and drums playing a
1 CONC nd the city left in peace. But an English minister in Christ's Church i
1 CONC n Dublin, spoke up and demanded that the city should be taken over by th
1 CONC e English, Great England and it's army should not sign a treaty with Pap
1 CONC ists (Catholics). So the treaty was broken within a week and the Englis
1 CONC h marched in and were there as they were all over Ireland and kept it i
1 CONC n subjection. Well my uncle showed me the different breaches in the ol
1 CONC d walls that were defended by the citizens, even the women with stones i
1 CONC n their stockings helped to defend the breached and assisted the soldier
1 CONC s in every way.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Well I then got on a long car as it was called that brought the mail fr
1 CONC om Bruff and all the small towns and villages to Limerick Post Office. B
1 CONC ruff is 15 miles to the south of the city and the coach came in every mo
1 CONC rning arriving in Limerick about 9:30 and then going back again at 3:3
1 CONC 0 in the afternoon. It had 2 horses and long sorts on each side the pass
1 CONC engers
1 CONT sat back to back facing in the centre. They used rugs of their own; as m
1 CONC ost people did in those days, even on the trains. Well I went out in th
1 CONC e Mail Coach and got to Grange about 12 miles out on the Bruff road. M
1 CONC y Uncle John and my grandmother, who was alive at that time lived on th
1 CONC e old Hannan Farm. My Aunt Margaret, who was my Uncle's wife was there o
1 CONC f course. I got off the car at the police station near a short road or b
1 CONC oreen that led from the state road up to the farm house. Well it was lik
1 CONC e Ruth at the Well. As I stood there a young girl who was driving cows f
1 CONC rom one part of the farm across the road to go up to the farm house wher
1 CONC e the cow houses were. Well this young girl that our Mary always remind
1 CONC s me of was my sister Annie who married Tom Cusack years afterwards. A n
1 CONC ice red head said to me "Are you Tom?", so of course I said "Are you Ann
1 CONC ie?" Well as the boreen was steep and rough, she put me on the back o
1 CONC f a donkey, "Now you can ride up in style", so up I went and being a Dub
1 CONC lin Jackeen I rode the donkey in the kitchen door and was not Granny, Un
1 CONC cle John and Aunt Margaret surprised, when I said "How are you Granny?
1 CONC " as most Dublin boys would express grandmothers' names, she gave me a d
1 CONC irty look and would not shake hands, I found out afterwards that she tho
1 CONC ught I was not respectful in calling her Granny. My Uncle John, Aunt Mar
1 CONC garet, and Annie were the finest people I had ever met, and I will alway
1 CONC s remember them. They are all in Heaven now. It was heaven for me for pe
1 CONC rhaps a month, up with the dawn, looking at cows being milked and the mi
1 CONC lk strained and put in what was called cream troughs and keelers, the ke
1 CONC elers were round about 4 inches deep and would hold 4 or 5 gals. of milk
1 CONC . The troughs were long about 8 ft. and 4 ft. and 4in. high, the milk wa
1 CONC s put in them and when after a few days the cream formed and came to a c
1 CONC ertain degree of ripeness it would be skimmed off by my aunt or Annie an
1 CONC d put in a churn barrel. A small amount of very cold water to help kee
1 CONC p it cool as it was churned, the churn was a large barrel connected t
1 CONC o a bar with cogs on the end that went out through a small window and th
1 CONC e donkey was hitched on to a wooden shaft and walked slowly in 6 circl
1 CONC e which was no bother to him and then
1 CONT just for 25 many minutes and slow again as my Aunt would wish to stop an
1 CONC d check how the churning was coming so I had a nice time riding the donk
1 CONC ey on churning day. It was a change for him as it was a delight to me. H
1 CONC e knew more about churning than I did, he would stop or go fast or slo
1 CONC w as he was told by the person at the churn. When it was in proper condi
1 CONC tion the butter was taken out through a trap door on the churn and washe
1 CONC d over and over with the coldest cleanest water from my Uncle's well tha
1 CONC t was always cold and never ran dry. It was then salted and some colouri
1 CONC ng put in it and packed into firkins lined with what was known as parchm
1 CONC ent paper. The farmers around that section had the finest land around th
1 CONC e south of Ireland. It was called the Golden Vale. Well the time come an
1 CONC d I had to go back to school again in Dublin. The fond memories of thos
1 CONC e days remain with me yet. I used to think if Heaven was like how that c
1 CONC ountry looked to me as I used to go up the hill at the and of the hous
1 CONC e always green with cows grazing around me. What a view I could see a pa
1 CONC rt of the River Shannon when the day was clear and across the countr
1 CONC y I could see the steam from the trains on their way from Limerick Cit
1 CONC y to the different stations very far away. Well back again I went back t
1 CONC o Dublin, went to school again.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	What time I lost in all this travelling kept me back at school as the
1 CONC y never put you in the same class you were in when you left, always a lo
1 CONC wer one so they would be sure you would pass the examinations that wer
1 CONC e every July and inspectors not the school master or teachers examined y
1 CONC ou and travelled all over, to all schools under the National Board of Ed
1 CONC ucation. The teachers got a bonus on every pupil that passed his exams
1 CONC , then we used to get the month of August for vacation. I used to go wit
1 CONC h my brother on trips to his customers all around the county Dublin, Wic
1 CONC klow, Kildare, and so got to know the country and all it's beauties an
1 CONC d mixed with the people. As I was William's brother, I was well-treated
1 CONC . Boys how hungry I used to get, I could eat every hour. How apples, pea
1 CONC rs, plumbs could disappear when I got them, more of that little Heaven
1 CONC . Well I should have been well on to the time for leaving school, but m
1 CONC y sister Bridget who was a housekeeper for a cousin of ours, whose wif
1 CONC e had died and left him with five
1 CONT children. Mat, Joe, Jimmy, Nan and Chris. Nan is in the Convent, Jimmy d
1 CONC ied when I was back in Limerick for the last time. Well as Bridget ha
1 CONC d a bar room or as we called it a public house and groceries and provisi
1 CONC ons in a place 11 miles from Limerick and she could not get a license ex
1 CONC cept if there was a man in the place, I was sent down and was that man
1 CONC . She got the license and only gave up the place to marry Patrick Maguir
1 CONC e; we called them the Guares. He and his brother had a forge and als
1 CONC o a store for flour meal and bran as the farmers did not have to go mile
1 CONC s to town they could get the stuff from the Guares. I stopped there tw
1 CONC o and a half years back in school again and so easy in 5th 2nd stage tha
1 CONC t I was in, in Dublin how I used to be put teaching the other grades o
1 CONC r books as it was called, and teaching the young kids catechism and thos
1 CONC e prayers I had a nice time and I had my own hurling club and used go t
1 CONC o near places on Sundays to hurdle other kids clubs. There was a big men
1 CONC 's club also. Pat Guare was the captain and his brother and some of my c
1 CONC ousins were members of the team. They were very good and won the champio
1 CONC nship of the County and some cups. I only got cut knuckles and crack o
1 CONC n my shins with hurleys. Well when Bridget got married I went back to Du
1 CONC blin and school again. It seems that my father did not try to get me t
1 CONC o face life and a future as he should I must have always been just a chi
1 CONC ld to him, but Katie who was my mother and sister and friend all in one
1 CONC , who took care of the house for my father. Brother Will and I, Pat wa
1 CONC s in a Pub (in a Publick House Post-Office and Grocery) the outskirts o
1 CONC f the County Dublin so he was forgotten, I used to see him once in month
1 CONC s. Until he got a job in Lucan a beautiful village 7 miles from Dublin (
1 CONC Royal Arms Hotel) you could go to it by train or steam train. This trai
1 CONC n had two cars and was run on a narrow track along the side of the roa
1 CONC d from the city to Lucan and back. The engine was boxed in and the wate
1 CONC r tanks were flat things on the top. How that thing could throw dirty sm
1 CONC oke and frighten horses. I think I could run as fast as it could go.
1 CONT 	Now back to my life in Dublin, I find it hard to get back to those day
1 CONC s but will try. We went to live in a house in the North Circular Roa
1 CONC d a half hour walk from the Centre, where my father and brother worked a
1 CONC nd where I had to walk all across town to work in a big grocery and butc
1 CONC her shop, although the same firm had seven shops as we called them I wa
1 CONC s the one who got the job furthest from home. I worked from 8:30 A.M. t
1 CONC o 7:30 P.M. and all Friday night and all Sat night for 4 shillings a wee
1 CONC k. That was good old Ireland's way to help its young people, Under Briti
1 CONC sh control, but the Irish themselves had a bit to do with these things s
1 CONC o why blame England for everything. They never had or never will hav
1 CONC e a good business just always afraid to expand but put the money in bank
1 CONC s. I had been signed on in that shop for 3 years to serve my time as the
1 CONC y called it, but my health broke down some from the long hours, and I go
1 CONC t a chance from the manager to go to the country to rest up so I went t
1 CONC o Grange to my Uncle John and Aunt Margaret and that heavenly view fro
1 CONC m the hill.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Now I must go back to a time before I went to the Grocery. I passed a
1 CONC n examination at Brown and Nolans. They printed bibles and prayer book
1 CONC s and a lot of religious books and some other books. I am sure as it wa
1 CONC s a first class printing concern I got the paper to have signed by my fa
1 CONC ther, but I got cold feet on my ways home and tore up the paper and thre
1 CONC w it in the river as I was crossing it on my ways home. I then got a jo
1 CONC b in a stationers shop but was not bound down or indentured for if I bro
1 CONC ke my indentures I could be put in Prison. Well I stayed there a month l
1 CONC earning to print visiting cards, wedding invitations and ads for small b
1 CONC usiness concerns. He would only give me 2 and 6 pence a week. He would s
1 CONC how me how to set up type work & machine by foot like a sewing machine i
1 CONC f I went fast I would be caught in the jaws of the machine as I had to p
1 CONC ut in one piece of printing paper with the right hand and take it out wi
1 CONC th the left. Why risk being crippled for life for about 60 cents per wee
1 CONC k, so I walked out one Sat night and never went back. I then got a job i
1 CONC n an office it was The John White and Son Glass and China merchants wit
1 CONC h the wholesale and office in
1 CONT one part of Dublin City and the other across the City in a fashionable s
1 CONC ection. I was to assist the book keeper so I entered the day books a
1 CONC s I got them from the others shop every morning as they used these in th
1 CONC eir charge accounts. I got one every morning and returned the other on
1 CONC e I entered them in a ledger as I got them and had to call on the phon
1 CONC e to get the press on a lot of things they did not enter in the day book
1 CONC s. At times it was a headache to get the information I never could under
1 CONC stand why they did not sometimes put in the customer's name and often no
1 CONC t the address but nearly every day I had to check on what they sold fo
1 CONC r so much money. I copied letters and bills that were sent out every eve
1 CONC ning and I posted them as I went home. I was there 3 months and as the b
1 CONC ook-keepers leg had got better, he had broken his leg in an accident s
1 CONC o my smart Alec boss Mr. John White always wearing a tall hat, long coa
1 CONC t spats and thinking no one was as good as he was, would not give me a d
1 CONC ecent wage and the book-keepers leg was better I got sick of him and goi
1 CONC ng across town to get the bank money and bank it. He at several times pa
1 CONC ssed me on the street as I would be on my way to the P.O., as it close
1 CONC d at 6 O'clock, and he and an old rascal of a friend would be coming ove
1 CONC r to our office to plan things about some special business as I say the
1 CONC y never recognized me so one evening they had lady friends with them an
1 CONC d were standing on the side walk and I came along. He saw me coming an
1 CONC d turned his back, so I just walked across the street and did not pay an
1 CONC y attention to him or his friends. A few days after, the book-keeper sai
1 CONC d to me, Mr. John says you did not tip your cap to him and his friends w
1 CONC hen you were on your way home a few evenings ago, so I said he never see
1 CONC s me so why should I tip my cap to him. I only salute a lady or a Priest
1 CONC , so that shut him up. I got out of there soon after John White was a le
1 CONC ader in the wrong Men's Club and a full pledged Free Mason. My Irish cou
1 CONC ld not stand that combination so then I tried the stationery and printin
1 CONC g.
1 CONT 	Then I got the job in the big grocery store. I went for 18 months t
1 CONC o a pub in a village called Raheny which was three miles by train on th
1 CONC e line from Dublin to Howth which is a headland jutting out into Dubli
1 CONC n Bay. I worked there from 7 in the morning until 10 at night, ate my me
1 CONC als as I could as I worked. It was a case of wait on some customers, ru
1 CONC n into the kitchen, eat a bit, and keep an eye out to get paid or some o
1 CONC f them would walk out without paying, If I stayed at the counter over lo
1 CONC ng when I went in again the table was cleared off, so that was that. I h
1 CONC ad to go to 7 o'clock mass on Sundays, walk about two miles and then ea
1 CONC t breakfast and open the bar at 10 o'clock until 10 at night. Was busy a
1 CONC ll day Sundays as the Dublin men used to come out in the trains about ev
1 CONC ery hour back and forth from Dublin to Howth which was only 9 miles. (Ra
1 CONC heny was about 3 miles all right for travellers). So then the last trai
1 CONC n in was 20 minutes after nine so I had to tidy up and then walk up th
1 CONC e road as far as the railway station. That was my life for 18 months an
1 CONC d I was supposed to get every Thursday off, but the old boss had a far
1 CONC m and would always go out early that day above all others and then tel
1 CONC l me he would be sure to let me go next week. He used to go on a bat(?
1 CONC ) often so could or would not want to be in the bar if only for 1 da
1 CONC y a week. I was tied up all the time and had poor resting privileges s
1 CONC o I jacked that job and went back to the manager of the grocery store ag
1 CONC ain he was glad to have me so I got 6 shillings per week and only left t
1 CONC here when my health broke down, I think it was because I had not enoug
1 CONC h food or rest at that Raheny Pub. We were busy there several days whe
1 CONC n there was horse races in Baldoyle near Howth. A brother of Peter Mahe
1 CONC r the great American boxer, his name was Micheal, a big strong boaster
1 CONC , but a great help to me. He helped me to keep the fresh guys from tryin
1 CONC g to gip on payments of their drinks, as many of them would carry ou
1 CONC t a tray of drinks to some of the so called ladies sitting on jaunting c
1 CONC ars we called them outside cars. I used to watch out the windows every c
1 CONC hance I had to look up from my work at the bar and see some of the fello
1 CONC ws leave the tray against the wall and go to get on the car
1 CONT to get away.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	The boss and an old maid sister of his as well as Mike used to help i
1 CONC n another extension of the bar opened for race days. So I would say Mik
1 CONC e that fellow did not pay so Mike would jump over the counter and out th
1 CONC e door like a shot, and that fellow was pulled off the car and brought i
1 CONC n and pay for the drinks and give his apology. So when that happened a f
1 CONC ew times it got around amongst the smart race goers I got much better
1 CONC . I used to try to get the money before they took the tray out but the
1 CONC y would make believe getting the money out of their pockets, grab the tr
1 CONC ay and go to the door. Of course they always said they were going to pa
1 CONC y for the drinks. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Well as I said I went to Grange to stay a month or so, but my brother J
1 CONC ohn who was running the bar and restaurant and the brokerage business a
1 CONC t the markets got a cold and it got to pneumonia that was late in Januar
1 CONC y and he died in March, Annie was with him running the business she ha
1 CONC d some in from Uncle John and Aunt Margaret's often, she being brought u
1 CONC p by them. She did not want to stay there all her life so she came in t
1 CONC o Limerick to John. When John got sick I had to come into the city the
1 CONC n there was my father who had given up work on account of age, Katie cam
1 CONC e from Dublin to help Annie, as my sister Margaret that worked there al
1 CONC l her life, had got married to Maurice Dore, Eddie's father. She lived h
1 CONC alf a mile from us and had three children. Eddie, Minnie, and Bridie Mau
1 CONC rice worked in a big store like the Outlet in Providence and had charg
1 CONC e of the men's apparel department. Well he got sick and died so we too
1 CONC k Eddie, a cousin took Minnie and another took Bridie. Poor Margaret wen
1 CONC t as a house keeper to a priest so there were four of us and that was i
1 CONC n 1896.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Then I got used to doing everything. I used to buy the whiskey in the d
1 CONC istillery and blend it myself with the help of a friend of my brother Jo
1 CONC hn. When I got to know how to do these things I was on my own. Then anot
1 CONC her friend, a Michael Coffee broke me into the Brokerage business in th
1 CONC e markets. In the same way I became an expert and made my own friends. T
1 CONC hen
1 CONT in 1901 my father died so I was surely stuck there then. So the executo
1 CONC r of John's will had us work together, then mortgaged the business t
1 CONC o a bank and raised money and gave it to Annie's husband as dowry. He ha
1 CONC d a big farm five miles from town and his brother living with him, and h
1 CONC is sister in the next farm. That left Katie and me with a load of debt t
1 CONC o the bank in our hands. So we did all we could for some years then Kati
1 CONC e married Joe Hannan, a sort of cousin who was out in the U.S. for 16 ye
1 CONC ars and had come home to buy a business so they got married and lived wi
1 CONC th me. So from the day of the marriage the whole idea was to work me ou
1 CONC t and take over the business. I saw and heard how the cat jumped and wat
1 CONC ched for a good break to get away and leave them face things as they ha
1 CONC d money and I had not. I went to one of my brother John's old friends Mi
1 CONC chael Coffee, he got me to a friend who was a lawyer and was also a frie
1 CONC nd of John's. So I took his advice and left things to myself and him
1 CONC . I had made a lot of improvements such as fixing up roofs, putting in n
1 CONC ew windows, a bathroom and new stove where they only used to burn turf o
1 CONC n an iron grating down low on the floor. I also got a drain from the sta
1 CONC ble yard up the street a bit where our customers used to put up when i
1 CONC n shopping and made box stalls there that good blooded horses could be l
1 CONC ocked in safely when there was a fair, which we had 4 times a year. We a
1 CONC lso kept the owners of these horses overnight as we had more rooms tha
1 CONC n we ourselves. Ma used to stop all the time with us, also two young gir
1 CONC ls Agnes Daly and Ellie Lynn also Lil Ryan. All were very nice good girl
1 CONC s and the 8 of them left us one by one to become nuns, first Agnes the
1 CONC n Lil. Then as soon as I left with Minnie to come out here Ellie went w
1 CONC e heard she was a nun, then lost sight and sound of them out here. All t
1 CONC he time from the death of his father Eddie Dore stopped there and slep
1 CONC t with me.
1 CONT 	He would not live with Joe and Katie so he went to live with some aunt
1 CONC s and uncles on a farm away in the west section of Limerick. Well thes
1 CONC e girls were friendly with Annie then Katie we were like one big family
1 CONC . Agnes and Lil going to Convent School and Ma and Ellie working in a gr
1 CONC eat big dry goods store like the Outlet. I watched my business and saw t
1 CONC hat the farmers were not planting oats and wheat but putting their farm
1 CONC s to grass and not making much butter as when the old people like my Aun
1 CONC t Margaret died out, the young ones did not like to work so they milke
1 CONC d the cows and sent the milk to one of the numerous dairies that spran
1 CONC g up every 5 miles or so as there were a lot of good farms. The dairie
1 CONC s were owned by the farmers, a sort of cooperative, with a dairy manage
1 CONC r and butter maker usually a girl trained to making butter so that Marga
1 CONC ret took samples of the milk as it was brought into the Creamery as we c
1 CONC alled then, he then tested it for water, butterfat etc. I used to help o
1 CONC ne do it when I could get a day or so off between seasons when I would r
1 CONC ide on my bike to the different aunts or uncles houses. Well it came t
1 CONC o a showdown with Joe & Katie, if I tried to fight it in law I would onl
1 CONC y lose money so I settled with them, got my money put in a bank right aw
1 CONC ay.
1 CONT 	Minnie Katie her sister and Elly Lynn were still stopping there but whe
1 CONC n there was a settlement with me. (Ma) that is Minnie and Katie and the
1 CONC n Eddie left there Elly stopped for sometime and as I say went to be a N
1 CONC un. Ma and Katie (her sister) got a room in the next street and I got on
1 CONC e with a young man a superintendent of schools. So I went around saw al
1 CONC l my friends as I had a bike I did not want be idle and spend my money
1 CONC . I spent so many years working I was never paid enough. Well I wrote t
1 CONC o Ma's brother Bill who was out here and had two uncles and cousins. H
1 CONC e wrote home all about conditions out here and the opportunity to get t
1 CONC o advance oneself. So Ma and I talked it over and as Bill and his brothe
1 CONC r John who was also here working at the jewelry shops. We talked it ove
1 CONC r with Mrs. Keane and I said if the farm we came out we could see if th
1 CONC e farm Bill and John writing about was a good thing. We would let her kn
1 CONC ow and if the account was good she would sell the farm at home and com
1 CONC e out with her two sons Tim and Tom and two daughters Lina and Katie. Ka
1 CONC tie did come out a few years after we did and stopped with us until sh
1 CONC e died.
1 CONT 
1 CONT At that time there was a price war on between the Cunard Line and the Wh
1 CONC ite Star line that was flying between England Ireland and the U.S. A lo
1 CONC t of the Irish got to know about it got together and came in groups fo
1 CONC r 30 dollars and 4 dollars Head Tax, 30 dollars for the trip and 4 dolla
1 CONC rs for the U.S. So Ma got with some girls she knew a few of them well, a
1 CONC nd I got in with a bunch of Athletes that were coming out here to play h
1 CONC urling games. It was a good chance at the time as the shipping war migh
1 CONC t be settled anytime. Well we both took the chance and although Ma an
1 CONC d I were on the same ship I did not see her from Sunday until Thursday o
1 CONC r Friday. Ma's sister Lina come to Queenstown and saw us off. We saile
1 CONC d from Queenstown on Sunday and got in the following Sunday afternoon. A
1 CONC s it was Sunday the First and Second class passengers could be checked i
1 CONC n but as there were hundreds of the third class. A great many on that tr
1 CONC ip of the Irish, and then there was a lot from all parts of Europe the
1 CONC y were on when we got on in Queenstown.
1 CONT 	A passengers ticket is checked and visa-ed then we got in a large tug
1 CONC , that goes out to meet the Liner in the outer harbour as there is an in
1 CONC ner and outer harbour like two horseshoes in shape so as we got on the l
1 CONC iner we wore checked our visas shown and stamped after we were examine
1 CONC d by a Doctor. The tender or tug did not leave the Liners side until al
1 CONC l were aboard so we sailed out of Queenstown at 1 o'clock on Sunday an
1 CONC d got in to N.Y. on the following Sunday afternoon November 25 1905. W
1 CONC e therefore had to wait on board ship until Monday and the revenue men w
1 CONC ho look over the credentials and check for contraband when all was corre
1 CONC ct we then took a cab with our suitcases and got the trunk sent on to At
1 CONC tleboro. We met a Policeman sure enough his name was Gaffney. I asked hi
1 CONC m where the Simpson house was I showed him a picture post card of Park s
1 CONC treet and said that bridge is not on this picture but the place I want i
1 CONC s somewhere at that side of this street. He said we are putting this bri
1 CONC dge here as the trains run on a level crossing when it is finished the t
1 CONC rains will run up and down from N.Y. to Boston. It must be Mrs. Corcoran
1 CONC s boarding house you want. I said that is the name of the place I want
1 CONC . So he said that is it across the street. So Ma and I went over up th
1 CONC e stairs walked in to the dining room and there was Bill and John seate
1 CONC d at a table eating supper cool and calm said they did not know the trai
1 CONC n would be in for another half hour just think how dumb a person can b
1 CONC e when you could throw a stone from the station to Park street.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Well I could not get a room that night but could get one the next nigh
1 CONC t so I slept with Bill and John that night and Ma went to her cousin’s h
1 CONC ouse in Beacon street. Charley Creahan and his wife and two children. M
1 CONC a stopped there some weeks as a Mrs O'Keefe another friend to Bill and J
1 CONC ohn did not have a room. We got Ma in with Anna that is now married to F
1 CONC rank Shughrue, so I got a room from the Corcorans that a man had died i
1 CONC n a few days before. That did not bother me it was a nice room upstair
1 CONC s near the dining room with a bathroom at each and of a long hall. The r
1 CONC oom and board was Four Dollars and 50 cents per week and we got three me
1 CONC als a day and two on Sundays, good food and attendance and clean rooms.
1 CONT 	So Bill showed us around town for a few days and brought us down to Joh
1 CONC n Creahan's house he was Ma's uncle and had a wife two daughters Katie a
1 CONC nd Annie two boys Willie and Jimmy. Ma and I went out up North Main stre
1 CONC et to see the wonderful farm we were told about I believe Coreen Riley o
1 CONC wns that place now and has part of the farm sold for building lots. Wel
1 CONC l the house was old wanted a lot of fixing the barn was falling apart an
1 CONC d a cow would die with the hunger the grass was so poor. So Ma and I wro
1 CONC te to her mother told her what we saw and advised her to stay on her ow
1 CONC n farm and home. She'd never like out here after having a good house an
1 CONC d cows and good land all her life. So that was the end of that. Ma an
1 CONC d I went around to a lot of Jewelry shops or factories as we were aske
1 CONC d what experience we had I said we were what you call green horns, bu
1 CONC t I stated what I did for a living when at home and said Ma was a dres
1 CONC s maker and we wanted to make good in this Country and then get married
1 CONC . So we got a job at the Attleboro Manufacturing Co in Pearl St. Mr Wilc
1 CONC he the foreman, put me kicking a press as it was called cutting out piec
1 CONC es of jewelry or parts 10 hours a day 12 cents per hour. Ma got a job a
1 CONC t the string up bench that is where girls put parts of jewelry on to som
1 CONC e wires which are afterwards coloured and treated in the colouring room
1 CONC . Ma got not to like the Maher meals (where she stayed with Anna Shughru
1 CONC e) and she come to a Miss Curry in Park street and got along fine. We bo
1 CONC th saved what little we could manage and banked it and so in July 1907 i
1 CONC t was Attleboro celebrating Old Home Week. We had vacation and got marri
1 CONC ed in St. Johns Church. The one all our children where baptised in and w
1 CONC ent to until they were too old to go to Sunday School any more. Father O
1 CONC 'Connell was Parish Priest that time so Bill and Katie Ma's sister who h
1 CONC ad come out and was stopping also at Miss Curry's house and worked in th
1 CONC e same factory with us. They stood up as Bridesmaid and Best Man. My bro
1 CONC ther Pat who left Ireland at last came out and lived in Corcorans’ and g
1 CONC ot a job stamping in the factory where we worked and stayed there unti
1 CONC l years after he got sick had an operation and died. Katie also got a so
1 CONC rt of virus fever and was in hospital about a month she was only out her
1 CONC e a few years. Ma and I said we were going to go to New York for the hon
1 CONC eymoon but went to Newport as we got a good account of a place
1 CONT to stay from a friend. We did not know that time that Newport was more c
1 CONC lassy for a honeymoon than New York but we learned very fast I tell you
1 CONC . Ma and I went to live in a boarding house up in Bank street and then g
1 CONC ot a tenement upstairs in 60 Pearl street. It was there Katie lived wit
1 CONC h us until she died and Pat also lived with us and Ma's brother Bill wh
1 CONC o was an engraver at Smith and Crosbys Gold and Silver Factory. Well al
1 CONC l five of the children were born in that house and I went to work in Saa
1 CONC rts the Mrs O'Keefe I spoke of before, come and lived downstairs so sh
1 CONC e had Miles, Margaret, George called (Hope) and Dorris. George died som
1 CONC e years after Dorris. He married Mary McConville had 4 or 5 boys, was i
1 CONC n the U.S. Navy and in business after he got out but had a very nice hom
1 CONC e and family at the time he died of some virus infection that was rampan
1 CONC t about that time. His wife Mary got married to a gentleman Lee Smith wh
1 CONC ose wife had died some years ago. He is interest in banking and The Apc
1 CONC o Mossberg Co. Well back to our own story. After Tom our oldest and onl
1 CONC y child at the time was about 18 months old, Ma took it into her head sh
1 CONC e wanted to go back to Ireland and see her Mother and family as her fath
1 CONC er had been dead some years when she left home. Katie had died that year
1 CONC . Pat was still with us, so as I thought if more children should come al
1 CONC ong she would never be able to go back. So we got tickets from Frank Bow
1 CONC en who was the shipping agent and went on our trip bundling up the bab
1 CONC y and away we went to Boston and on ship to Queenstown then on to Croo
1 CONC m where Ma's brother Tom met us and brought us to the Home, we stayed an
1 CONC d visited all her friends and mine and I also went up to Dublin to se
1 CONC e a brother that was sick, and who died about a year after I got back he
1 CONC re to Attleboro. So Ma was satisfied.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Pat in the meantime stopped in his regular room and got his meals fro
1 CONC m Mrs O'Keefe. We also went to see Mrs Cusack that is Annie married him
1 CONC , and Joe and Katie my sister that left the Gerald Griffin Street place
1 CONC . They had one daughter who now writes to me and married a man named Mad
1 CONC den, who was a druggist, he has died since Xmas they had I boy who die
1 CONC d last year and 3 girls 2 of whom write to me one in Dublin and the youn
1 CONC gest in Limerick.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Margaret that married Maurice Dore, Katie who married Joe Hannan, Bridg
1 CONC et who married Pat Maguire, Annie who married Tom Cusack. They are all g
1 CONC one. Uncles and
1 CONT Aunts cousins all gone but me, and I believe 2 boys William’s sons are i
1 CONC n Dublin are carpenters from the last account I got about them. So Tomm
1 CONC y grew up then Mary come then Bill then Dorothy and again John the young
1 CONC est all born in 60 Pearl street went to St Johns Church, Attleboro schoo
1 CONC ls and High. Then Tom and John went to Providence College. Tom first an
1 CONC d John after he got cut of High school. Bill preferred Boston college s
1 CONC o used to commute and graduated Cum Laud. We left the Pearl street hous
1 CONC e and we live in now from Frank Guild, and there you are and here I am.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I am writing this last, instead of first, as I forgot some things that h
1 CONC ave to be filled in about some years between my visits to Limerick fro
1 CONC m Dublin.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Well, when I was very young my father would take me for walks some time
1 CONC s to the Park, to the Museums, and then, again, out to the Botanic Garde
1 CONC ns (It is in the Golden Vale the richest land around that part of the co
1 CONC untry. Grange is a farm about 12 miles from Limerick City to the South a
1 CONC nd is near Lough Gur. Count Lord Fedamore was getting rents from the far
1 CONC mers in this area.) a beautifully laid out place with trees and flower
1 CONC s and plants from all over the world. I asked him who the Hannans were a
1 CONC nd where did we cone from, I got an evasive answer. Perhaps he though
1 CONC t I was too young and might not understand, so all I know is the Grandfa
1 CONC ther and Grandmother of all the Hannans lived in that house in Grange. M
1 CONC y father had at least 3 sisters that I knew and he had two brothers, Unc
1 CONC le John in Grange and Uncle William in Dublin who worked in the wine an
1 CONC d cordial department in Cebeoins Factory. He was not friendly to me s
1 CONC o I did not bother talking to visiting him much. I much preferred hammer
1 CONC ing at something with the carpenter or trying to make something that I h
1 CONC ardly ever finished — the regular kid stuff.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	My mother's name was Hannan, from another part of the County of Limeric
1 CONC k and she had 2 brothers and 3 sisters, Aunt Conway, Aunt Shaughnessey a
1 CONC nd Aunt Maloney. Aunt Conway was married to Tom Conway who had five sons
1 CONC : Father John, a Priest, then Pat, Tom, Michael and Jim. And, five daugh
1 CONC ters: Helen, Maggie and two others who were in the U.S. in my time. Aun
1 CONC t Shaughnessey, who was also married to a farmer about 3 miles from the
1 CONT City of Limerick had two sons: John & Ned. There were four daughter: Mar
1 CONC y, Margaret, Nora and Catherine. Nora and I were very chummy and used t
1 CONC o go out there on the bike often on Sunday morning after Mass and come h
1 CONC ome at night. It was a pleasant change after a week in the city to wal
1 CONC k around the farm and orchard and look how the crops were coming and wha
1 CONC t was being planted and how the farm produced and talk things over wit
1 CONC h the older folks. As I was making my living on the production of the fa
1 CONC rms, I had to have a good understanding of the condition of what I calle
1 CONC d my people. Their troubles were my troubles and I always learned someth
1 CONC ing as I was brought up in the City of Dublin and only got to the countr
1 CONC y for the few visits that I have written about. I had a lot to learn an
1 CONC d they each liked me to visit them in turn and I learned a lot.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Aunt Conway lived near where Ma's people lived and went to the same cha
1 CONC pel. My mother's people were only a few miles from Ma's home, as Newtow
1 CONC n Crecora, County Limerick was my mother's home. Years after my mother h
1 CONC ad died in Dublin and I went to live and work in Limerick, I used to rid
1 CONC e out the seven miles to my cousins’ (Uncle Ned's son and two daughters
1 CONC ) on Saturday afternoon and stay over until Monday. They also had a larg
1 CONC e farm and there was a forth or rath on the farm down near the main roa
1 CONC d and another some distance. The house was some distance in from the roa
1 CONC d (Newtown Road) and before I got the bike I always liked walking. So, S
1 CONC aturday afternoon I dressed up for walking and had knickers or riding br
1 CONC eeches, leather leggings to the knees and, of course, my walking stick
1 CONC , a flower in the button hole and walked out some miles.
1 CONT Then, I crossed in over a fence and went across some fields and up throu
1 CONC gh a grove of trees. As it got dark on this occasion I would, as I ofte
1 CONC n did before, call out to my cousin Martin, “Martin, I am here -- McGint
1 CONC y," as he used to call me McGinty. So he would come out and get up o
1 CONC n a fence and hold up a lantern that helped a lot, but I knew my way pre
1 CONC tty well.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Well, this time as I crossed the fields and saw two more or less soun
1 CONC d white things, I thought it was one of the farm people bringing in mil
1 CONC k in two pails. But I said to myself, she is late, so I said "Good eveni
1 CONC ng Ma’am." I got no answer so repeated, “Good evening Ma’am, you are ou
1 CONC t late." Still no answer. As I walked up closer I found it was a cow wit
1 CONC h two white spots. I must say I laughed out loud and told the story whe
1 CONC n I got to the house.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Another time Martin had another cousin; Jim Ryan, a brother of the gir
1 CONC l Lil that I have mentioned as being in the house with Ma and Agnes an
1 CONC d Ellie, that went to be a nun. He and Martin pushed me into the room wh
1 CONC ere Mary and Gracie were, then fastened the latch on the outside. I kep
1 CONC t quiet. Mary said “Who is there? I think it is you McGinty so they play
1 CONC ed a trick on you," and both of them laughed. It was dark and they wer
1 CONC e in bed and my Aunt and Uncle were sleeping in the next room so I worke
1 CONC d carefully and pried up the hinges, the sort that when you lift the doo
1 CONC r they come apart. Fortunately for me I could lift and pull so I got i
1 CONC t open at the hingeside and had a good time getting through. It was on
1 CONC e time I was glad I was not big or fat. So the boys would not
1 CONT let me in to bed. One slept in each bed so I took a blanket off one be
1 CONC d and slept on the floor. How we laughed at it many a time. I told my Au
1 CONC nt about it a long time after and she had a good laugh. That was the hou
1 CONC se my mother was born in, so I always felt much at home, in fact our hou
1 CONC se. I visited Uncles, Aunts, or Cousins; we always had a pleasant time a
1 CONC s they all liked music, dancing, and no drinking. If I was seen on my wa
1 CONC y to any of these homes the word got around and that night first one cou
1 CONC ple would stroll in, then another, until a good crowd of the boys and gi
1 CONC rls arrived. So then the music would start and a dance would be in order
1 CONC . The boys and girls gave me a great welcome and it always meant a dance
1 CONC .
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	I was out there several times in Lent. No dance, but the rosary, all kn
1 CONC eeling down around the fireplace, no fun. If you visit one friend's hous
1 CONC e, down goes the kettle for tea and cream cake or apple cake and they wo
1 CONC uld not spare the apples. You got the kettle put on in every house. If y
1 CONC ou did not take the tea, well it would be more or less a slight so if yo
1 CONC u know your way around, you drink all the tea you get and like it. I did
1 CONC , anyway.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Well, I still know that there were a lot of events that happened in th
1 CONC e years I was going to school in Dublin, so I must go back to perhaps 18
1 CONC 86 to 1889. There was the Egyptian war with England. I saw the soldier
1 CONC s leaving on ships don on the river Liffey. I even played sick from scho
1 CONC ol at times to see them. They went from there to England and on to Egypt
1 CONC . It was a tough war and gave England a great fright for a
1 CONT few years. I don’t remember how long it lasted. I was too young for tha
1 CONC t sort of thing.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	There were at that time members of Parliament, that is, men chosen to r
1 CONC epresent the Irish National Parliament in England. there were a great ma
1 CONC ny men who fought for the freedom of Ireland. Wonderful leaders who devo
1 CONC ted their lives to the fight for freedom and suffered death in prisons a
1 CONC nd deportation and even death on the gallows. Great noble men such as Ro
1 CONC bert Emmet, Wolfe Tone and Lord Edward Fitzgerald to name a few. They fo
1 CONC ught with swords and guns. Then there was Daniel O'Connell, Parnell, Dav
1 CONC itt, the two brothers John and William Redmond, and Healy the jealous fe
1 CONC llow that turned against Parnell and became a favorite of the English Go
1 CONC vernment so that he got a high position in Ireland. When the split cam
1 CONC e Ireland was very much divided. Some saw him a patriot and could not se
1 CONC e that he was in the pay of the English politicians who sought to divid
1 CONC e the Irish Parliamentary Party that was pressing them hard and showin
1 CONC g them up before the world.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Against Parnell they used their usual tactics -- if you cannot beat hi
1 CONC m fair, do it any foul way. So they worked what I know to be the Badge
1 CONC r Game. Farnell was the leader and was an idol of the Irish Nation for h
1 CONC is fine leadership. And, he was a perfect gentleman. Well, a Captain O'S
1 CONC hea of the English Army, with his wife, Kitty, was used to bait a trap f
1 CONC or Parnell. It was timed and sprung in the regular way those people ha
1 CONC d planned it so that Parnell was disgraced. There were the courtroom act
1 CONC s where all the proofs were lined up so that the poor gentleman was brok
1 CONC en in spirit and health. A lot of the good friends fell away from
1 CONT him. That's why I say Ireland and his colleagues were divided and the Pa
1 CONC rliamentary Party never got back on its feet again. The New Redmonds an
1 CONC d the Healy gang spoiled what the great Parnell had given his life to bu
1 CONC ild up. I will not get into politics as it would take me months to writ
1 CONC e and try to explain and I was very young and did not take interest in t
1 CONC hose things, but I was told by my father about many things and he read t
1 CONC he papers every day. I used to ask him about things I did not understan
1 CONC d about Ireland and its fights for freedom. Then I used to read a lot ab
1 CONC out Ireland in stories and the history of Ireland from the bygone days b
1 CONC efore St. Patrick came to convert the Irish people.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	There was also a land league that was got up to fight against absente
1 CONC e landlords -- English Generals who were given some of the finest sectio
1 CONC ns of Ireland and who never spent either time or money in the country. T
1 CONC hey forced the farmers who lived in what the landlords called their lan
1 CONC d to pay rents to them, the very land that was their father's and was ha
1 CONC nded down to them for generations. So a William O'Brien who was a membe
1 CONC r of Parnell's party put up a good fight for the settlement of the dispu
1 CONC te and to get the farms for the Irish people. He was imprisoned for maki
1 CONC ng speeches, of course, by the English, but the fight got stronger. It w
1 CONC ent on for many years so that by the time I was in Limerick, that is whe
1 CONC n I came to live there before I came out here, the farmers were permitte
1 CONC d to buy their own land on what was so many years purchase. Pay the ban
1 CONC k so much for so many years and the banks did up the landlords. He peopl
1 CONC e then tried to build up the businesses and the farms, but owing to th
1 CONC e poverty and persecutions thousands had to go to foreign lands to try t
1 CONC o live. That was more or less why I
1 CONT became one of those that could not see any way to make a living and so c
1 CONC ame out here. It was the best thing I ever did for God has been very goo
1 CONC d to me and my wife and we are blessed with five of the finest childre
1 CONC n a father and mother could ever expect to have. God bless them. We than
1 CONC k Him every day.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	Well, when I was in Dublin Atlantic Cable, came in to the River Liffe
1 CONC y as it was being shown in different ports of the world. I heard about i
1 CONC t at school and went away out towards the and of the Liffey, to the Nort
1 CONC h Wall as we called it. I waited that Sunday for several hours and as i
1 CONC t was two miles from home and I got hungry I asked a coast guard who ha
1 CONC d a telescope about where the ship would be. He told me it was waiting f
1 CONC or high tide to get over the bar out in Dublin Bay and it would not be i
1 CONC n for hours. So I went home, had dinner and my father came back with m
1 CONC e and the ship was in. It had 6 masts and also had paddles as it was a p
1 CONC addle wheeler. The paddles were as big as a small cottage. In the dictio
1 CONC nary there are the measurements. I knew them at that time, but forget th
1 CONC em now. The ship stayed about a month and you could get in to see all ov
1 CONC er it for one shilling. They also had theatricals. I did not have a shil
1 CONC ling in those good old days so did not go on board, so got an eyeful fro
1 CONC m outside.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	As we lived on the north side of the city at that time I used to walk u
1 CONC p North Frederick St. where the Orange Bulb and the National Club were n
1 CONC ext door to each other. I saw and heard a great many speeches
1 CONT the balcony on the second floor. It was from there that Parnell spoke th
1 CONC e night he was released from Kilmainham Jail. There were torchlight proc
1 CONC essions and bands all the way from the jail to the club which must hav
1 CONC e been about three miles. It was one of the great events in my young lif
1 CONC e.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	There was a Sunday near Christmas when my father and I went for a wal
1 CONC k out towards the Clontarf Road. Clontarf was a nice but small bathing b
1 CONC each about three miles from the centre of Dublin and could be reached b
1 CONC y train. We saw an engine of a train lying on the bed of a signalman who
1 CONC se signal house was close to the tracks. He, fortunately, was at Mass a
1 CONC t the time. It was a shunting engine and had got off the rails in some w
1 CONC ay. I never got particulars as I used to study my lessons for the next d
1 CONC ay after supper or tea as we called it. We always went to bed about 10:0
1 CONC 0 o'clock, except my brother William, he generally got in about 11:00 o'
1 CONC clock.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	The first time I saw a real Indian was at a Wild West show at the Rotun
1 CONC da, a very old building always used for political meetings and concerts
1 CONC . This time it was the real Buffalo Bill (Bill Cody) with cowboys at cam
1 CONC p and singing songs and then chasing the Indians round and round a big r
1 CONC ing like a circus ring with drop netting between the people and the acto
1 CONC rs. These nets had forests and rocks figures on them as you looked throu
1 CONC gh them you saw what was a forest opposite to you and all the fighting w
1 CONC as in between. Hengler’s Circus used to come from England every May an
1 CONC d go away first of October. They had a great big building
1 CONT out back in the Rotunda Gardens, like a small park close to the principa
1 CONC l street, O'Connell St. running north and south and across the street fr
1 CONC om the clubs I mentioned where the Naturalist Club was. I saw Prince Geo
1 CONC rge when he visited Ireland when he was only a boy. I also saw Lord Robe
1 CONC rts and Lord Kitchener and General Wolsley as the boys in the school kep
1 CONC t tabs on the great military events and some of us were sick and did no
1 CONC t go to school when there was a great military general and hundreds of s
1 CONC oldiers and bands (even if they wore the red coat) we wanted to see an
1 CONC d hear. They used to have reviews and mock battles as we called them, i
1 CONC n the park, often lasting a whole week. We were not hungry or tired al
1 CONC l day, but when it was all over it was a long way home. If I was late, w
1 CONC ell, I was always home for tea and I could be playing with one of the bo
1 CONC ys from school, you know, so I did not have to explain anything. Outsid
1 CONC e of these things I hardly ever went playing in the streets like some ot
1 CONC her boys -- I stayed home. My mother wanted it that way, so I studied m
1 CONC y lessons and then got a thriller western and so got to know all about t
1 CONC he wild west to my mind. The "Bowery Boys" was a great story in a smal
1 CONC l paper magazine out once a week -- lots of fun. Nothing like what the
1 CONC y write now. The Queen Clipper of the Clouds and a Thousand Leagues Unde
1 CONC r the Sea were favorites with the boys. Sometimes we got a thriller lik
1 CONC e Calamity Jane and Deadwood Dick. The boys treasured these and you woul
1 CONC d only pass them on to a real friend.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 	I often, especially in August vacation time, went to Kingstown, it is i
1 CONC n Dublin about 20 minutes in the train from Westland Row Station. It ha
1 CONC s a lovely harbor and the mail boats, there were 5 of them, carried
1 CONT the mails to and from Holyhead in England across the Irish Sea. They wer
1 CONC e Ulster, Munster, Leinster, Connaught and Ireland. One of them was alwa

0 @N1694@ NOTE The Tithe Applotment Books are a vital source for genealogical rese
1 CONC arch for the pre-Famine period, given the loss of the 1821-51 Census rec
1 CONC ords. They were compiled between 1823 and 1837 in order to determine th
1 CONC e amount which occupiers of agricultural holdings over one acre should p
1 CONC ay in tithes to the Church of Ireland (the main Protestant church and th
1 CONC e church established by the State until its dis-establishment in 1871).
1 CONT 
1 CONT There is a manuscript book for almost every civil (Church of Ireland) pa
1 CONC rish in the country giving the names of occupiers of each townland, th
1 CONC e amount of land held and the sums to be paid in tithes. Because the tit
1 CONC hes were levied on agricultural land, urban areas are not included. Unfo
1 CONC rtunately, the books provide only the names of heads of family, not othe
1 CONC r family members.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The books have been digitally imaged, and a database giving surname, for
1 CONC ename, county, parish and townland created. All of these fields can be s
1 CONC earched, and there is also a browse facility, which allows users to surv

0 @N1709@ NOTE About Landed Estates Court Rentals 1850-1885
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Landed Estates Court “Rentals” are an important source for Irish fam
1 CONC ily history, as they provide extensive information about land occupatio
1 CONC n in the mid-nineteenth century, often including information back to th
1 CONC e 18th century. They were printed to facilitate the sale of bankrupt est
1 CONC ates and include information about tenants, the lots they rented, the te
1 CONC rms of their tenancy, as well as a map specifying the boundaries. More t
1 CONC han 500,000 tenants are recorded in these documents dealing with more th
1 CONC an 8,000 estates throughout the country.
1 CONT 
1 CONT By the mid 19th Century many of the large Irish estates were in seriou
1 CONC s financial difficulty. Land owners found themselves legally obliged t
1 CONC o pay out annuities and charges on their land, mainly to pay mortgages o
1 CONC r ‘portions’ to family members contracted by marriage settlements and/o
1 CONC r wills of previous generations. All of these payments had to be met, be
1 CONC fore the owner/ occupier could take an income from their estate.
1 CONT 
1 CONT By the time of the Famine, as prices for sale or rental of land plummete
1 CONC d, the monies that had to be paid out from the individual estates remain
1 CONC ed the same, and many Irish estates became insolvent as debts exceeded e
1 CONC arnings. However, the landowners could not sell their estates to dischar
1 CONC ge their debts, because the land was entailed. In 1848 and 1849, two Enc
1 CONC umbered Estates Acts were passed to facilitate sale of these estates. Un
1 CONC der the second act, (12 & 13 Vict., c. 77), an Encumbered Estates Cour
1 CONC t was established, whereby the state took ownership of these propertie
1 CONC s and then sold them on with a parliamentary title, free from the threa
1 CONC t of contested ownership.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Establishment of the Land Courts
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Encumbered Estates Court was established in 1849. In 1852, it was re
1 CONC placed by the Landed Estates Courts, which was itself superseded in 187
1 CONC 7 by the Land Judges Court, part of the Chancery Division of the High Co
1 CONC urt. Although there were some differences in the powers of these courts
1 CONC , their principal function remained the same, to sell off insolvent esta
1 CONC tes.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Land Courts system was the first significant step towards the break-
1 CONC up of the old estates in Ireland. From the genealogist’s perspective, th
1 CONC e Rentals have an added value, because the estate records (rentals, maps
1 CONC , leases) that would have existed prior to these sales, no longer surviv
1 CONC e. This is because once the parliamentary grant to title was secured b
1 CONC y purchase from the Land Courts, there was no need to retain any of th
1 CONC e documentation regarding previous land title.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT What the Rentals are and where can they be found
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Rentals are effectively printed sale-catalogues, which were circulat
1 CONC ed to prospective purchasers in advance of the sale. They were compile
1 CONC d with the intention of attracting purchasers and of providing informati
1 CONC on on the estate in a clear and uniform manner. The Land Courts sold est
1 CONC ates in every county in Ireland, and the Rentals as a whole cover larg
1 CONC e parts of the country. The estates now sold included urban as well as r
1 CONC ural property, and many of the Rentals relate to houses and other buildi
1 CONC ngs in villages, towns and cities. The information is printed and presen
1 CONC ted in a standard manner.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Structure of the Rentals/Sale-catalogues
1 CONT 
1 CONT The title page in a Rental identifies the estate and gives the date an
1 CONC d place of the sale. This is usually followed by brief descriptive parti
1 CONC culars of the estate and its situation, intended to attract prospectiv
1 CONC e buyers. Anyone who has read the property section of a newspaper, wil
1 CONC l know what to expect in this section.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The descriptive particulars are generally followed by observations and c
1 CONC onditions of sale.
1 CONT 
1 CONT To the genealogist the critical information contained in these catalogue
1 CONC s are the Rentals, especially the Lot descriptions. These outline the ow
1 CONC nership and occupation history of the lot, the quantity of land and th
1 CONC e yearly rent that can be charged. Most significantly, they also includ
1 CONC e the list of tenants, the size of the holding and the terms of tenure.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Where a tenant held by lease, rather than on a yearly tenancy, the parti
1 CONC culars will also name all lives contracted for (usually three), and an
1 CONC y of those named still alive at the time of the sale. So the informatio
1 CONC n contained in the Rentals can allow the genealogist to document connect
1 CONC ions between close family members going back one or more generations.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Rentals also usually include a map to situate the estate or lot in r
1 CONC elation to the surrounding countryside, and often also a detailed map o
1 CONC f the lot itself. In the case of urban property, you will find a villag
1 CONC e or town-plan.

1 CONT Inquest Proceedings
1 CONT At Croom Hospital on Friday 23rd inst.,
1 CONT Dr. Clery, Coroner, opened an inquest
1 CONT touching the death of Michael Casey,
1 CONT Cloughakeating, Patrickswell, who suc-
1 CONT cumbed on that morning to injuries
1 CONT sustained by being knocked down by a
1 CONT car
1 CONT Supt. Cooney intimated that he did not
1 CONT intend to give any evidence other than
1 CONT evidence of identification and medical
1 CONT evidence, as papers were being sent to
1 CONT the Attorney-General for his instructions.
1 CONT 
1 CONT WIFE'S EVIDENCE
1 CONT Mrs. Christina Case, wife of thes de-
1 CONT ceased, giving evidence of identification,
1 CONT stated her husband was a farmer, and
1 CONT was 50 years of age. On Wednesday last
1 CONT the deceased left the house and went in
1 CONT the direction of Patrickswell, carrying a
1 CONT barrel of water. When he returned he
1 CONT remained indoors until 5.30 p.m., when
1 CONT he went out on a bicycle to Patrickswell
1 CONT to feed the caves at Faha, where he had
1 CONT grazing taken. He was in good health,
1 CONT and had no drink taken. Later, witness
1 CONT saw her husband in Croom aCounty
1 CONT Hospital , where he was unconscious.
1 CONT 
1 CONT MANY INJURIES
1 CONT Dr. James Hogan stated the deceased
1 CONT man was unconscious when admitted to
1 CONT the hospital on Wednesday, and died on
1 CONT Friday.   he man was organically sound,
1 CONT and on examination it was found that he
1 CONT had injuries around the left eye, with
1 CONT sub-conjunctional haemorrhage, lacera-
1 CONT tion of the face and legs. He was suffer-
1 CONT ing from fracture of thebase of the skull,
1 CONT and never regained consciousness. Death
1 CONT in witness;s opinion was due to 
1 CONT and haemorrhage, following fracture of
1 CONT the base of the skull, as a result of
1 CONT violence. The injuries could have been
1 CONT caused by being struck by some object
1 CONT such as a motor car.
1 CONT The Coroner then adjourned the in-
1 CONT quest indefinitely.

0 @N1783@ NOTE The Valuation Office Cancellation records were updated when the nam
1 CONC e of the occupier or lessor changed, not when the person changed. So th
1 CONC e record was not updated if the occupier changed but the new occupier ha
1 CONC d the same name as the old, e.g. if the tenancy passed on to a son wit
1 CONC h the same name as his father.
1 CONT 
1 CONT This can make it difficult to be certain who the record is referring t
1 CONC o at any particular time. What appears to be a single person occupying l
1 CONC and for a period could in theory be any number of people with the same n
1 CONC ame.
1 CONT 
1 CONT However a distinction was made between people with the same name who wer
1 CONC e in the records at the same time in the same townland, e.g. a father an
1 CONC d son who each occupied land. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Patrick Hannan [circa 1800 - 1860] occupied a plot of land that crosse
1 CONC d the borders between Newtown (Lot 7), Ballyregan (Lot 1) and Skehanag
1 CONC h (Lot 3). Around 1860/1861 this land passed to his wife Grace and the
1 CONC n to his brother Edmond. By 1901 that plot of land was occupied by Patri
1 CONC ck's son Ned. Patrick's brother Edmond was also the tenant in Lot 6 in N
1 CONC ewtown.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In Newtown Lots 6 and 7 were recorded as occupied by Edmond Hannan unti
1 CONC l 1865 when the occupiers' names were changed to "Edmond Hannan Senr" an
1 CONC d "Edmond Hannan Junr" for Lots 6 and 7 respectively. I'm assuming tha
1 CONC t Edmond senior is the original occupier (both Lots) and Edmond junior i
1 CONC s his son or nephew. "Senr" and "Junr" may have been used to distinguis
1 CONC h between two men of different ages, rather than to specify a father/so
1 CONC n relationship. It's possible that Edmond took over the tenancy after th
1 CONC e deaths of Patrick and Grace until Patrick's son Ned was able to run th
1 CONC e property himself.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In Skehanagh (Lot 3) and Ballyregan (Lot 1) the name on record  remaine
1 CONC d Edmond Hannan from 1861 to 1894, but probably passed to Ned in 1865, a
1 CONC t the same time as the change in the record for Lot 7.

0 @N1904@ NOTE What is in This Collection?
1 CONT This collection of probate registers from the State of Victoria covers t
1 CONC he years 1841-1989.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The collection consists of an index to probate registers for Victoria lo
1 CONC cated in the Public Record Office in Melbourne, Australia. Most of the d
1 CONC ocumentation listed in the probate registers are wills handwritten in na
1 CONC rrative form.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Probate records are court records created after an individual's death th
1 CONC at relate to a court's decisions regarding the distribution of the estat
1 CONC e to the heirs or creditors and the care of dependents. This takes plac
1 CONC e regardless of whether there is a will or not. The Probate Registry i
1 CONC s responsible for determining, on application for a grant of representat
1 CONC ion, what document or documents constitute the last will of the decease
1 CONC d and/or who is entitled to be the personal representative of the deceas
1 CONC ed. When these determinations have been made, a grant is issued to the e
1 CONC state of the deceased person.
1 CONT 
1 CONT What Can These Records Tell Me?
1 CONT The following information may be found in these records:
1 CONT 
1 CONT Probate
1 CONT 
1 CONT Name of testator
1 CONT Death date
1 CONT Place of residence and address
1 CONT Occupation

1 CONT Collection History
1 CONT The probates and wills in this collection were kept and recorded by seve
1 CONC ral different government offices over time (Supreme Court of N.S.W. fo
1 CONC r the District of Port Phillip; Master of Equity, Supreme Court; Maste
1 CONC r of the Supreme Court; and Registrar of Probates, Supreme Court). The p
1 CONC robates and wills were subsequently archived in the Public Record Offic
1 CONC e Victoria where they have been maintained in two separate series: Proba
1 CONC te and Administration Files (Series VPRS 28) and Wills (VPRS 7591). Th
1 CONC e wills in this collection were originally among the estate papers i
1 CONC n a probate application but were subsequently separated. The most recen
1 CONC t probate records (2002 and later) are available only from the Victoria
1 CONC n Probate Office.

1 CONC d may have arrived in Dublin 1880 or 1881. Patrick Hannan was replaced a
1 CONC s the tenant listed in the Valuation Office Cancelled Books for Ballyreg
1 CONC an in 1879, so the move to Limerick city likely happened in 1879 at th

1 CONT 
1 CONT Thomas describes his earliest memory as being able to see a prison and a
1 CONC n "asylum for the feeble minded" (now Limerick Prison and St. Joseph's H
1 CONC ospital) over the wall at the back of the cottage he lived in. He also s
1 CONC aid there was a forge at the end of the street. It's likely that back o
1 CONC f the cottage faced onto Roxboro Road or Ballysimon Road, or a street of
1 CONC f one of those roads. It's not likely to be the house where Tom Molone
1 CONC y lived on Cornwallis/Gerald Griffin Street because Thomas lived there a
1 CONC round 1900 and would have known it was the same place.

1 CONC r of us and that was in 1896."
0 @N1951@ NOTE "Aunt Conway was married to Tom Conway who had five sons: Father Jo
1 CONC hn, a Priest, then Pat, Tom, Michael and Jim. And, five daughters: Helen
1 CONC , Maggie and two others who were in the U.S. in my time."
0 @N1952@ NOTE William does appear in the Valuation Office records after 1851. I
1 CONC t is not known if he left the area or passed away around that time.
0 @N1953@ NOTE I have added Michael, Edmond, William and Charles Hannan to this tr
1 CONC ee as brothers of Patrick Hannan.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Apart from a Valuation Office tenure record stating that Charles and Mic
1 CONC hael and brothers, none of the evidence showing a connection between the
1 CONC se men directly states what their relationship is to each other. Howeve
1 CONC r the body of evidence, taken as a whole, suggests to me that these guy
1 CONC s are brothers.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The evidence, detailed below, includes records showing land shared betwe
1 CONC en them and passed amongst them and their families (or at least people w
1 CONC ith the same surname), records showing that they were godparents to eac
1 CONC h others' children and records showing that their descendants were witne
1 CONC sses to each others' marriages. Four of the men were raising families i
1 CONC n the 1840s.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Shared land
1 CONT Until some time between 1851 and 1860 William, Edmond and Patrick  share
1 CONC d bog land in Newtown.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The men also occupied neighbouring lands independently of each other, bu
1 CONC t in a Landed Estate record from 1849 the lands occupied by Patrick, Mic
1 CONC hael, William and Edmond in Kilpeacon were listed in one lot, as if the
1 CONC y were a  family, with each man named individually.
1 CONT 
1 CONT By 1860 William's land had passed to Michael and Patrick's land passed t
1 CONC o Edmond in 1861.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Baptisms
1 CONT Edmond was married to Catherine Barry. Edmond and Catherine were the god
1 CONC parents to Patrick's son Michael (1850 - 1937). Charles was godparent t
1 CONC o Edmond's daughter Bridget (b1843) and Michael's son James (b1839). Mic
1 CONC hael's wife, Mary Meade was godparent to Patrick's daughter Ellen (b1845
1 CONC ).
1 CONT 
1 CONT Patrick, Michael, Edmond and Charles all had children baptised in the 18
1 CONC 40s which means they were of the same generation.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Marriages
1 CONT Edmond's daughter Mary married James Ryan in 1872. Patrick's grand-daugh
1 CONC ter Helen Conway from Carnane was a witness.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Michael's son John married Johanna Mulcahy in 1881. The priest was Patri
1 CONC ck's grand-son John Conway from Carnane and one of the witnesses was Pat
1 CONC rick Conway, likely to be John Conway's brother or other relative.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Michael and Charles
1 CONT Michael occupied land without a house or buildings in Bawncouma, and sub
1 CONC letted an adjacent house to his brother Charles. I have not seen evidenc
1 CONC e that states that the Michael Hannan in Bawncouma is the same Michael H
1 CONC annan in Newtown, however the land Michael Hannan in Bawncouma occupie
1 CONC s does not have a house and there is no record of a Michael Hannan in an
1 CONC y of the nearby townlands apart from Newtown, therefore I have conclude
1 CONC d that they are most likely to be the same person.
1 CONT 
1 CONT William
1 CONT The land records for William are the only records that I can definitivel
1 CONC y associate with him. His land in Newtown was passed to Michael by 1860
1 CONC . It seems like he either passed away or he moved. There are records o
1 CONC f several people with the name William Hannan whose children were baptis
1 CONC ed in Fedamore in the 1830s, any or none of which may refer to the "corr
1 CONC ect" William Hannan. As such the evidence that William is a brother rath
1 CONC er than, e.g., an uncle, is weaker than it is for the other putative bro
1 CONC thers of Patrick. Considering the land shared with the other men I wil
1 CONC l assume that William is a brother, until or unless I find evidence to t
1 CONC he contrary.

0 @N1958@ NOTE There was a John Hannan in Fedamore parish who may have been Patric

1 CONC ) and Patrick's daughter Honora (b1853). Denis Quirk was also a witnes
1 CONC s to John Hannan's marriage to Nora Quirk in 1829, which suggests that p
1 CONC erhaps John was related to the Newtown Hannans, possibly a brother. Joh
1 CONC n and Nora appear to have moved to St Michael's parish in Limerick cit
1 CONC y in the 1830s.

0 @N1962@ NOTE "Well, Uncle Tom came to Dublin to give evidence in a dispute whic
1 CONC h was being tried in the Four Courts which was a High court of Ireland i
1 CONC n Dublin.[...] He took me to Limerick and I stayed for three months, was
1 CONC n't that fine, no school to go to for all that time, it just shows ho
1 CONC w a kid's mind works, That was the first time I met my Aunt Maloney. M
1 CONC y mother's sister"
0 @N1963@ NOTE Tom Maloney was married to one of Thomas Hannan's mother's sisters
1 CONC . 
1 CONT 
1 CONT There was a Michael Moloney baptised 23 Apr 1855 in St. Michael's paris
1 CONC h in Limerick, his parent's were Thomas Moloney and Johanna Hannan, wh
1 CONC o married in Fedamore 6th Feb 1852. This fits with Tom living in Cornwal
1 CONC lis Street and marrying a Hannan from Newtown, however I have not seen o
1 CONC ther evidence connecting that family to the Hannans or Maloneys in thi
1 CONC s tree.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Thomas Hannan said that he first met "Aunt Maloney" when he came from Du
1 CONC blin to stay in Limerick for three months. That would have been in the 1
1 CONC 880s. Tom was a widower when he died in 1891, which puts Aunt Maloney'
1 CONC s death sometime in the 1880s or the very early 1890s.
1 CONT 
0 @N1964@ NOTE This property, 28 Cornwallis Street, was passed down to Tom from hi
1 CONC s father Michael who had been there since at least as far back a the ori
1 CONC ginal Valuation Office publication in 1850, so Tom may have been there a
1 CONC ll his life.
1 CONT 
1 CONT There was a Hannan family living at 2 Cornwallis Street, though I have n
1 CONC ot seen evidence connecting them to the Hannans in this tree. Thomas Han
1 CONC nan and several of relatives have lived in 28 Cornwallis Street, so reco
1 CONC rds referring to Hannans living in Cornwallis Street are sometimes relev
1 CONC ant, but some of those records refer to the "wrong" Hannans.
