4 TEXT SAD DROWNING FATALITY IN THE CITY
5 CONT 
5 CONT A very painful feeling was caused in city circles yesterday morning, whe
5 CONC n it become known that Mr. Thomas Conway, licensed vintner, George stree
5 CONC t, had accidentally lost his life by drowning. Mr. Conway, who was in hi
5 CONC s 43rd year, was in his usual health on Thursday, attended to business
5 CONC , and left his house during the night to post a letter; then, accordin
5 CONC g to his usual practice, intending to take a walk before retiring to res
5 CONC t. He was seen passing in the direction of Wellesley Bridge some few min
5 CONC utes before 11 o'clock, and that appears to be the last time he was see
5 CONC n alive. He was then perfectly cool and collected. Yesterday morning som
5 CONC e fishermen getting ashore at the North Strand discovered him lying fac
5 CONC e downwards on the beach near the small bridge leading to Barrington's b
5 CONC ank, and the occurrence being reported to the Thomondgate police, the re
5 CONC mains were recovered and conveyed to the residence of the lamented decea
5 CONC sed. Mr. Conway, as stated was in the prime of life. He was a native o
5 CONC f the country, having been born at Boherlode, near Cahercornlish, but h
5 CONC e had been at business in the city for several years back. Personally, h
5 CONC e was a great favourite, courteous and obliging on all occasions. Ther
5 CONC e is, as evidenced at the inquiry, great sympathy with his widow and rel
5 CONC atives, and the sad end of the deceased caused quite a gloom among a lar
5 CONC ge circle of the friends and acquaintances of Mr. Conway.
5 CONT 
5 CONT Inquest
5 CONT Mr. James F. Barry, J.P., City Coroner, held an inquest at three o'clock
5 CONC , at the residence of the deceased, as to the cause of death.
5 CONT The following were the jury - George Clancy (foreman), William Savin, Jo
5 CONC hn Casey, Patrick Coyle, Matthew Quinlan, Patrick Hartigan, Charles Cope
5 CONC , J. O'Mahony, William Whittaker, J. P. Lynch, Michael Larkin, Thomas Bu
5 CONC rke.
5 CONT Evidence was given, District Inspector White conducting the inquiry.
5 CONT Delia Conway, wife of the deceased, Thomas Conway, stated she was marrie
5 CONC d for the last three years. They lived on very good terms. He was in hi
5 CONC s usual good health yesterday, and she was with him at devotions in th
5 CONC e Augustinian Chapel at a quarter to eight last night. They afterwards c
5 CONC ame home, and her husband attended at the bar. She last saw him alive a
5 CONC t half-past ten o'clock, when he came upstairs. He asked witness to hav
5 CONC e some supper, and she replied she would wait until he returned. Decease
5 CONC d was in a good financial position, and did a good trade. When the decea
5 CONC sed did not return to the house up to half-past twelve witness began t
5 CONC o get uneasy about him. She sent the assistant, Ml. Horgan, down to th
5 CONC e Shannon Rowing Club and other places to look for him. About four o'clo
5 CONC ck witness gave up hope of her husband returning and she went to bed. De
5 CONC ceased was about 43 years of age.
5 CONT By a juror - It was the usual custom of the deceased to go for a walk af
5 CONC ter the closing of business, from halfpast ten to 11 o'clock.
5 CONT Michael Horgan, shop assistant, said he was eight years in the employmen
5 CONC t of the deceased. Witness was in the shop last night at a quarter to 1
5 CONC 1 o'clock with Mr. Conway. Witness reminded him as to posting a busines
5 CONC s letter, and he went out to post it. He did not see Mr. Conway alive af
5 CONC ter that. The shop was closed at 11 o'clock as usual, and about half-pas
5 CONC t 12 o'clock Mrs. Conway, who was uneasy, sent him to look for Mr. Conwa
5 CONC y. Witness failed to find him. after several inquiries, and returned tow
5 CONC ards half-past two o'clock.
5 CONT Michael McInerney, a fisherman, said he lived at the North Strand. Retur
5 CONC ning up the Shannon early yesterday morning after fishing he put in jus
5 CONC t below Cleeve's Factory. There were two other men with witness, and i
5 CONC n getting out of the boat he saw the body of a man on the beach on the e
5 CONC ast side of the bridge leading to the slip or dockyard. The body was fac
5 CONC e downwards. Witness reported the matter at once to the police.
5 CONT District-Inspector White - Did the body appear to be suffering from an
5 CONC y violence?
5 CONT Witness - No, sir.
5 CONT District-Inspector White - The hat was not there
5 CONT Witness - No, it was not. The body was fully clothed, the top coat, bu
5 CONC t there was no hat.
5 CONT District-Inspector White - Who found the hat, Sergeant Keating?
5 CONT Sergeant Keating - Sparling, I have him hear.
5 CONT By Mr. Larkin - There was no mud on the back of the clothing of the dece
5 CONC ased. The bridge was the next one to Barrington's Bank.
5 CONT To a juror - There is no chain protection. Full tide was at 12.22. Ther
5 CONC e were over 19 feet of water there. It was very windy. It was very wind
5 CONC y between 11 and 12 last night.
5 CONT Mr. Casey said the place was a dangerous spot.
5 CONT Thomas Sparling said he lived at 28, Patrick street. Witness found the h
5 CONC at (produced) in front of Mr. Lee's gate, at ten mintues past eight o'cl
5 CONC ock. He found it on one of the metal pillars. Witness did not know of th
5 CONC e occurence.
5 CONT By a juror - There was dirt on the leaf.
5 CONT District Inspector White said the hat did not appear to have been in th
5 CONC e water. The wind could have blown it up. Where the hat was got was abou
5 CONC t two hundred yards from where the body was found lying.
5 CONT Dr. T. K. Mulcahy said he examined the body. There were no marks of viol
5 CONC ence, save one dent in the forehead. In witness's opinion that occurre
5 CONC d after death. Death was due to drowning - asphyxiation, the cause of dr
5 CONC owning.
5 CONT By a juror - The dent would not require much force. The action of the wa
5 CONC ter, the drop from the bank, or a struggle, if he struggled, against dro
5 CONC wning might have caused the dent.
5 CONT District Inspector White said that was all the evidence. Two policemen
5 CONC t saw him at two minutes to 11, and he was alright then. As to the steal
5 CONC ing of any property of the deceased, that report was done away by the fa
5 CONC ct that his watch and chain were in the house.
5 CONT This concluded the evidence, and the jury after a short deliberation fou
5 CONC nd:- "That the deceased, Thomas Conway, was found in the River Shannon o
5 CONC n the night of 17th February instant ; that we have no evidence to sho
5 CONC w how he got into the water, but we believe it was accidental. And we fu
5 CONC rther tender to Mrs. Conway and family our deep sympathy in her bereavem
5 CONC ent."
5 CONT Mr. Clancy said attention should be directed to the condition of the bri
5 CONC dges leading to Barrington's Bank. One of them was a regular death-trap
5 CONC , in a rotten condition, and without any protection.
5 CONT The Coroner said he thought the Corporation had no control over the brid
5 CONC ges.
5 CONT Mr. Casey said he agreed with Mr. Clancy. The wonder to him was that mor
5 CONC e people or children were not drowned there. It was a miracle how they e
5 CONC scaped, particularly with regard to the first bridge. He saved three chi
5 CONC ldren there some time ago.
5 CONT The proceedings ended.

5 CONT 
5 CONT A sad case of suicide is reported from near Fedamore. It appears that Mr
5 CONC . Patrick Conway, a respectable farmer, residing near that place, was i
5 CONC n Limerick on Tuesday and returned home in his usual health and spirits
5 CONC . He retired to bed at the customary early hour, but got up about half-p
5 CONC ast ten p.m., telling his wife that he wanted to see a sick cow. His wif
5 CONC e suggested to him to send the servant boy, but he decided on going hims
5 CONC elf. A considerable time elapsed, and as Mr. Conway did not return, hi
5 CONC s wife thought the cow required attention, and accordingly asked the bo
5 CONC y to go and give assistance. On proceeding to the cow-house he found Mr
5 CONC . Conway was not there, but on searching further discovered his body han
5 CONC ging from a rafter in another outhouse. He was suspended by the reins o
5 CONC f a horse. No motive can be assigned for the rash deed, and great sympat
5 CONC hy is felt for Mr. Conway's wife and relatives in their affliction.

5 CONT I remember also a fellow-student, Patrick Leo by 
5 CONT name, who got into trouble by his own fault at Croom 
5 CONT and elsewhere. Actuated by jealous rivalry of a school- 
5 CONT mate in study, he stealthily opened the schoolmate’s desk 
5 CONT and with a knife hacked to pieces the schoolmate’s most 
5 CONT valuable books. This schoolmate was Mr. John Conway, 
5 CONT afterwards parish priest of Feenagh, and now dead, as 
5 CONT hereinbefore stated. Upon investigation the act was 
5 CONT proved against Patrick Leo, who, under penalty of public 
5 CONT expulsion from the school, was adjudged to pay for the 
5 CONT books and upon his knees to apologize to the whole school 
5 CONT for his bad behavior. With floods of tears that bespoke 
5 CONT mortified pride, he paid the money and made the humil- 
5 CONT iating apology.

0 @N0212@ NOTE Hannie's mother's name is specified as Johannie Keane in her deat
1 CONC h record and not Bridget Hannon as we would expect given that she was th
1 CONC e daughter of Thomas Conway and Bridget Hannon. The other details in th
1 CONC e record match what we believe to be true about Hannie. Specifically th
1 CONC e address exactly matches that on Jeremiah's death record and the Ambros
1 CONC es' entry in the 1930 census.
1 CONT 
1 CONT There is a record of Hannie (recorded as "Hanora"), her sister Nora an
1 CONC d her son Keane travelling from Ireland to New York in 1897. Keane gav
1 CONC e "Carnane, Co. Limerick" as the residence from which he was travelling
1 CONC . There is also a record of Nora Conway travelling from Carnane to 11 Fl
1 CONC oyd St in 1898, which the record states is her sister's address. 11 Floy
1 CONC d St is where Jeremiah and Hannie were living in the 1900 Census.
1 CONT 
1 CONT This evidence strongly supports that Hannie (or Johannie) Conway from Ca
1 CONC rnane in my family tree (daughter of Thomas Conway and Bridget Hannon) w
1 CONC as Jeremiah Ambrose's wife. If that is the  case then Johannie Conway'
1 CONC s mother's name was not Johannie Keane as stated in the death record.

0 @N0223@ NOTE SAD DROWNING FATALITY IN THE CITY
1 CONT 
1 CONT A very painful feeling was caused in city circles yesterday morning, whe
1 CONC n it become known that Mr. Thomas Conway, licensed vintner, George stree
1 CONC t, had accidentally lost his life by drowning. Mr. Conway, who was in hi
1 CONC s 43rd year, was in his usual health on Thursday, attended to business
1 CONC , and left his house during the night to post a letter; then, accordin
1 CONC g to his usual practice, intending to take a walk before retiring to res
1 CONC t. He was seen passing in the direction of Wellesley Bridge some few min
1 CONC utes before 11 o'clock, and that appears to be the last time he was see
1 CONC n alive. He was then perfectly cool and collected. Yesterday morning som
1 CONC e fishermen getting ashore at the North Strand discovered him lying fac
1 CONC e downwards on the beach near the small bridge leading to Barrington's b
1 CONC ank, and the occurrence being reported to the Thomondgate police, the re
1 CONC mains were recovered and conveyed to the residence of the lamented decea
1 CONC sed. Mr. Conway, as stated was in the prime of life. He was a native o
1 CONC f the country, having been born at Boherlode, near Cahercornlish, but h
1 CONC e had been at business in the city for several years back. Personally, h
1 CONC e was a great favourite, courteous and obliging on all occasions. Ther
1 CONC e is, as evidenced at the inquiry, great sympathy with his widow and rel
1 CONC atives, and the sad end of the deceased caused quite a gloom among a lar
1 CONC ge circle of the friends and acquaintances of Mr. Conway.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Inquest
1 CONT Mr. James F. Barry, J.P., City Coroner, held an inquest at three o'clock
1 CONC , at the residence of the deceased, as to the cause of death.
1 CONT The following were the jury - George Clancy (foreman), William Savin, Jo
1 CONC hn Casey, Patrick Coyle, Matthew Quinlan, Patrick Hartigan, Charles Cope
1 CONC , J. O'Mahony, William Whittaker, J. P. Lynch, Michael Larkin, Thomas Bu
1 CONC rke.
1 CONT Evidence was given, District Inspector White conducting the inquiry.
1 CONT Delia Conway, wife of the deceased, Thomas Conway, stated she was marrie
1 CONC d for the last three years. They lived on very good terms. He was in hi
1 CONC s usual good health yesterday, and she was with him at devotions in th
1 CONC e Augustinian Chapel at a quarter to eight last night. They afterwards c
1 CONC ame home, and her husband attended at the bar. She last saw him alive a
1 CONC t half-past ten o'clock, when he came upstairs. He asked witness to hav
1 CONC e some supper, and she replied she would wait until he returned. Decease
1 CONC d was in a good financial position, and did a good trade. When the decea
1 CONC sed did not return to the house up to half-past twelve witness began t
1 CONC o get uneasy about him. She sent the assistant, Ml. Horgan, down to th
1 CONC e Shannon Rowing Club and other places to look for him. About four o'clo
1 CONC ck witness gave up hope of her husband returning and she went to bed. De
1 CONC ceased was about 43 years of age.
1 CONT By a juror - It was the usual custom of the deceased to go for a walk af
1 CONC ter the closing of business, from halfpast ten to 11 o'clock.
1 CONT Michael Horgan, shop assistant, said he was eight years in the employmen
1 CONC t of the deceased. Witness was in the shop last night at a quarter to 1
1 CONC 1 o'clock with Mr. Conway. Witness reminded him as to posting a busines
1 CONC s letter, and he went out to post it. He did not see Mr. Conway alive af
1 CONC ter that. The shop was closed at 11 o'clock as usual, and about half-pas
1 CONC t 12 o'clock Mrs. Conway, who was uneasy, sent him to look for Mr. Conwa
1 CONC y. Witness failed to find him. after several inquiries, and returned tow
1 CONC ards half-past two o'clock.
1 CONT Michael McInerney, a fisherman, said he lived at the North Strand. Retur
1 CONC ning up the Shannon early yesterday morning after fishing he put in jus
1 CONC t below Cleeve's Factory. There were two other men with witness, and i
1 CONC n getting out of the boat he saw the body of a man on the beach on the e
1 CONC ast side of the bridge leading to the slip or dockyard. The body was fac
1 CONC e downwards. Witness reported the matter at once to the police.
1 CONT District-Inspector White - Did the body appear to be suffering from an
1 CONC y violence?
1 CONT Witness - No, sir.
1 CONT District-Inspector White - The hat was not there
1 CONT Witness - No, it was not. The body was fully clothed, the top coat, bu
1 CONC t there was no hat.
1 CONT District-Inspector White - Who found the hat, Sergeant Keating?
1 CONT Sergeant Keating - Sparling, I have him hear.
1 CONT By Mr. Larkin - There was no mud on the back of the clothing of the dece
1 CONC ased. The bridge was the next one to Barrington's Bank.
1 CONT To a juror - There is no chain protection. Full tide was at 12.22. Ther
1 CONC e were over 19 feet of water there. It was very windy. It was very wind
1 CONC y between 11 and 12 last night.
1 CONT Mr. Casey said the place was a dangerous spot.
1 CONT Thomas Sparling said he lived at 28, Patrick street. Witness found the h
1 CONC at (produced) in front of Mr. Lee's gate, at ten mintues past eight o'cl
1 CONC ock. He found it on one of the metal pillars. Witness did not know of th
1 CONC e occurence.
1 CONT By a juror - There was dirt on the leaf.
1 CONT District Inspector White said the hat did not appear to have been in th
1 CONC e water. The wind could have blown it up. Where the hat was got was abou
1 CONC t two hundred yards from where the body was found lying.
1 CONT Dr. T. K. Mulcahy said he examined the body. There were no marks of viol
1 CONC ence, save one dent in the forehead. In witness's opinion that occurre
1 CONC d after death. Death was due to drowning - asphyxiation, the cause of dr
1 CONC owning.
1 CONT By a juror - The dent would not require much force. The action of the wa
1 CONC ter, the drop from the bank, or a struggle, if he struggled, against dro
1 CONC wning might have caused the dent.
1 CONT District Inspector White said that was all the evidence. Two policemen
1 CONC t saw him at two minutes to 11, and he was alright then. As to the steal
1 CONC ing of any property of the deceased, that report was done away by the fa
1 CONC ct that his watch and chain were in the house.
1 CONT This concluded the evidence, and the jury after a short deliberation fou
1 CONC nd:- "That the deceased, Thomas Conway, was found in the River Shannon o
1 CONC n the night of 17th February instant ; that we have no evidence to sho
1 CONC w how he got into the water, but we believe it was accidental. And we fu
1 CONC rther tender to Mrs. Conway and family our deep sympathy in her bereavem
1 CONC ent."
1 CONT Mr. Clancy said attention should be directed to the condition of the bri
1 CONC dges leading to Barrington's Bank. One of them was a regular death-trap
1 CONC , in a rotten condition, and without any protection.
1 CONT The Coroner said he thought the Corporation had no control over the brid
1 CONC ges.
1 CONT Mr. Casey said he agreed with Mr. Clancy. The wonder to him was that mor
1 CONC e people or children were not drowned there. It was a miracle how they e
1 CONC scaped, particularly with regard to the first bridge. He saved three chi
1 CONC ldren there some time ago.
1 CONT The proceedings ended.

1 CONT 
1 CONT A sad case of suicide is reported from near Fedamore. It appears that Mr
1 CONC . Patrick Conway, a respectable farmer, residing near that place, was i
1 CONC n Limerick on Tuesday and returned home in his usual health and spirits
1 CONC . He retired to bed at the customary early hour, but got up about half-p
1 CONC ast ten p.m., telling his wife that he wanted to see a sick cow. His wif
1 CONC e suggested to him to send the servant boy, but he decided on going hims
1 CONC elf. A considerable time elapsed, and as Mr. Conway did not return, hi
1 CONC s wife thought the cow required attention, and accordingly asked the bo
1 CONC y to go and give assistance. On proceeding to the cow-house he found Mr
1 CONC . Conway was not there, but on searching further discovered his body han
1 CONC ging from a rafter in another outhouse. He was suspended by the reins o
1 CONC f a horse. No motive can be assigned for the rash deed, and great sympat
1 CONC hy is felt for Mr. Conway's wife and relatives in their affliction.

1 CONT History of NLI's Catholic Parish Registers 
1 CONT "In the 1950s and early 1960s, the National Library of Ireland carried o
1 CONC ut a project to microfilm the surviving Catholic parish registers of th
1 CONC e entire island. Out of 1153 sets of registers, this project covered 106
1 CONC 6. Among the parishes whose records it does not include are: Rathlin Isl
1 CONC and (Co. Antrim), Crossgar (Co. Down); Clonfert, Fahy, Clonbern (Co. Gal
1 CONC way); Killorglin (Co. Kerry); Kilmeena (Co. Mayo); Rathcore & Rathmolyo
1 CONC n (Co, Meath); and the Dublin city and county parishes of Clontarf, Naul
1 CONC , Sandyford, and Santry. Almost all of these appear to have registers ea
1 CONC rlier than 1880 in local custody. In addition, the parishes of St John'
1 CONC s (Sligo town), Cappawhite (Co. Tipperary) and Waterford city have regis
1 CONC ters held locally which are fuller than those microfilmed by the Library

1 CONT           </strong> <br />
1 CONT           In order for you to be able to find records of your ancestor
1 CONC s online
1 CONT           someone first has to read the original handwritten records (or
1 CONT           photographs of the records) and type up the information on a c
1 CONC omputer.
1 CONT           This process is called <em>indexing</em>. There are then two f
1 CONC ormats
1 CONT           in which you can get the record information: <em>Indexes</em
1 CONC > which
1 CONT           have information copied from the original record and <em>image
1 CONC s</em>
1 CONT           (photographs) of the original record. An <em>index</em> will
1 CONT           typically have a subset of the information that can be found i
1 CONC n the
1 CONT           full record, for example this is the Civil Death Record inde
1 CONC x for John
1 CONT           Smith d1864 - <br />
1 CONT           <br />
1 CONT           Name <strong>JOHN SMITH</strong><br />
1 CONT           Year of Death <strong>1864<br />
1 CONT           </strong>
1 CONT           Group Registration ID N/R<br />
1 CONT           SR District/Reg Area <strong>Dublin South</strong><br />
1 CONT           Deceased Age at Death <strong>78</strong><br />
1 CONT           Returns Year <strong>1864</strong><br />
1 CONT           Returns Quarter <strong>2</strong><br />
1 CONT           Returns Volume No <strong>7</strong><br />
1 CONT           Returns Page No <strong>573</strong><br />
1 CONT           <br />
1 CONT           Note that this index only gives the year and quarter of the de
1 CONC ath. An
1 CONT           image of the original record would have the exact date of deat
1 CONC h,
1 CONT           profession of the deceased, cause of death, name of the inform
1 CONC ant,
1 CONT           relation of the informant to the deceased, etc.<br />
1 CONT           <br />
1 CONT           In some cases an image of the original record will not be avai
1 CONC lable,
1 CONT           and the information in the index is all that you will have. I
1 CONC t is
1 CONT           advisable to check the image, if available, because the imag
1 CONC e may have
1 CONT           valuable information not contained in the index, and because t
1 CONC here can
1 CONT           be mistakes in the index, where information has been transcrib
1 CONC ed from
1 CONT           the record incorrectly.<br />

1 CONT             People in Ireland didn't have a reason to know how old the

1 CONT             before the start of the Old Age Pension in 1909. They woul
1 CONC d often
1 CONT             under report their age. Usually the recorded ages of childre
1 CONC n were
1 CONT             correct. In my experience from reading the records, people w
1 CONC ould
1 CONT             start under-reporting their age in early adulthood. The inac
1 CONC curacy
1 CONT             of reported age tended to increase as they grew older. Discr
1 CONC epancies
1 CONT             also occurred when one person reported another's age. In th
1 CONC e case of
1 CONT             a record of death the informant might give an estimate of th
1 CONC e
1 CONT             deceased's age. This results in a disproportionate number o

1 CONT             The Old Age Pensions Act 1908 introduced a pension for 'elig

1 CONT             people aged 70 and over. It came into law in January 1909 ac

1 CONT             England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. This gave people a rea
1 CONC son to
1 CONT             know what age they were, and a reason to pretend that they o
1 CONC lder
1 CONT             than they were. There are many cases where people who
1 CONT             under-exaggerated their age for the 1901 Census then
1 CONT             over-exaggerated their age in 1911. In one case a man who cl

1 CONT             There were fines for late registration of births (and deaths

1 CONT             <strong id="idiosync_names">Name Variations</strong> <br />
1 CONT             <span>When you're searching for genealogical records it's im
1 CONC portant to know that a person's name can be presented differently in dif
1 CONC ferent records. Though literacy rates in Ireland improved dramatically d
1 CONC uring the second half of the 19th century, many people were illiterate
1 CONC . Priests and other record keepers would have been expected to know (o
1 CONC r decide) how to spell names. This is one reason why a peron's name migh
1 CONC t have speelling variations across records.<br/>
1 CONT <br/>
1 CONT Records almost always use the formal version of a person's first name. M
1 CONC any 19th century parish records are in Latin, using the "Latin-ised" for
1 CONC m of Christian names (surnames are always in English). In Latin the nam
1 CONC e changes to indicate son/daughter of, bride of, etc. For example "Joh
1 CONC n son of John" becomes "Johannes, filius Johannis". Click <a href="http:
1 CONC //www.from-ireland.net/irish-names/latin-names-in-english/">here</a> fo
1 CONC r a list of names tranlsted from Latin to English. In some cases there a
1 CONC re many ways one name can be formalised. For example, a woman called Joh
1 CONC anna, calling herself Hannie maybe reported in different records  as Joh
1 CONC anna, Hannie, Hanoria, Hanora. Some names do not have obvious Latin equi
1 CONC valents. For example Jane might be recorded as Johanna or Janita.<br/>
1 CONT <br/>
1 CONT If a child died it a later child in the same family would sometimes be g
1 CONC iven the same name. So it's not unusual to see two birth or baptism reco
1 CONC rds for what appears to be the same child in different years.<br/>
1 CONT <br/>
1 CONT Most parish records only list the names of the people involved, though s
1 CONC ome include a paragraph formally declaring the ceremony in Latin. For co
1 CONC nsitency the "transcriptions" of parish records in this tree list only t
1 CONC he relevant information from the record, with Latin names translated int
1 CONC o English.<br/>
1 CONT <br/>
1 CONT Wildcards can help with name variation on some sites like <a  href="http
1 CONC s://ancestry.co.uk">Ancestry</a>. If you put "McC*l*gh" in the last nam
1 CONC e field on the search page it'll match "McCallagh", "McCullough", "McCol

0 @N0529@ NOTE Valuation Office books 1824-1856
1 CONT The printed volumes of the Primary (or Griffith’s) Valuation, the recor
1 CONC d of Ireland’s first comprehensive property tax, have been available onl
1 CONC ine for many years now, and are a crucial part of the genealogical infra
1 CONC structure for the mid-nineteenth century. But the records which underli
1 CONC e and inform the printed valuation have never been digitised until now
1 CONC , and they contain more information about households and landholding tha
1 CONC n can be found in the printed version.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The valuation of Ireland was made for the purpose of levying tax on prop
1 CONC erty. The initial work of capturing information on every piece of proper
1 CONC ty in the country took place between 1830 and the mid-1860s, and the arc
1 CONC hives of this work are held by the National Archives. Since that time, t
1 CONC he valuation has been continuously revised and updated, and the revisio
1 CONC n documents are held by the Valuation Office. In general, archives relat
1 CONC ing to counties now in Northern Ireland are held by the Public Record Of
1 CONC fice of Northern Ireland in Belfast, although some are in the National A
1 CONC rchives. The work of valuation created a large collection of archives, w
1 CONC hich are now useful for researchers seeking information on a wide rang
1 CONC e of subjects, from family history to academic studies. These document
1 CONC s cover the entire country and, while the work was complex and technical
1 CONC , they were made according to a standard method and provide informatio
1 CONC n about families and society at a period when few other sources are exta
1 CONC nt.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The valuation work was carried out by professional valuators, assisted b
1 CONC y other staff, who worked their way through the country, county by count
1 CONC y, beginning in the north. The date of the work in each county varies. T
1 CONC hey recorded the information needed in Field Books, House Books and othe
1 CONC r documents. The work in the field was undertaken first, then the offic
1 CONC e work and, following an appeal process, the valuation was finalised.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Townland Valuation
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Townland Valuation was the first valuation and it took place under A
1 CONC cts passed between 1826 and 1836. The objective was to create a valuatio
1 CONC n of the entire country in counties, baronies, parishes and townlands. I
1 CONC ndividual occupiers were not named unless they held a house that was val
1 CONC ued at more than £5 after 1836, or £3 before that date. Information on t
1 CONC he land was collected, but did not relate to individual farms. Twenty-si
1 CONC x counties were valued in this manner before the system was changed.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Tenement Valuation
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Tenement Valuation was introduced in a piecemeal fashion and, in th
1 CONC e beginning, it overlapped with the continuation of the Townland Valuati
1 CONC on. The first Tenement Act was in 1846, following partial measures intro
1 CONC duced in 1844, and only covered counties not valued by the Townland Valu
1 CONC ation (Cork, Dublin, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford). The Tene
1 CONC ment Valuation was extended to the entire country with the 1852 Act. Und
1 CONC er the Tenement Valuation, every individual tenement or holding was reco
1 CONC rded, including the names of the occupiers, and the documents contain la
1 CONC rge numbers of names of householders. The field work and office work too
1 CONC k place in the same manner as in the Townland Valuation, and the draft v
1 CONC aluation prepared for appeals was published as the Primary Valuation, o
1 CONC r Griffith’s Valuation. Following the appeals, the valuation was finall
1 CONC y settled and recorded in the ‘cancelled books’ now held by the Valuatio
1 CONC n Office.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT There are four distinct kinds of books involved:
1 CONT 
1 CONT Field Books - The Field Books of the Valuation Office are manuscript boo
1 CONC ks that record the information required for the valuation of agricultura
1 CONC l land. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT House Books - The House Books of the Valuation Office are manuscript boo
1 CONC ks in which information on houses and buildings is recorded. The books i
1 CONC nclude houses and buildings situated in rural areas and in cities, town
1 CONC s and villages. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Tenure Books - The Valuation Office Tenure books are a series of manuscr
1 CONC ipt notebooks in which information required for the Tenement Valuation w
1 CONC as compiled. The Tenure Books are also known as Perambulation Books, a
1 CONC s the staff ‘perambulated’ or walked around the boundaries of the teneme
1 CONC nts.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Quarto Books - The Valuation Office Quarto Books are a series of manuscr
1 CONC ipt books relating to the valuation of houses and buildings in towns. Th
1 CONC e Quarto Books are found in all counties except Leitrim and Sligo, and i
1 CONC n some counties only a small number of books survive.
1 CONT 
1 CONT These records contain over 2 million names. They provide a comprehensiv
1 CONC e assessment of the rental value of Irish lands and property from the mi
1 CONC d-1820s to the mid-1850s. The books reveal where and when individuals re
1 CONC nted or owned property and provide rare glimpses of life in pre-famine I
1 CONC reland.

1 CONC s, legends, ballads, etc.- which were in danger of being lost - and to r
1 CONC ecord and maintain sites of historic interest.
1 CONT In December 1946 the Society produced its first, and only, journal. Thi
1 CONC s magazine made a valuable contribution to the study of Limerick's histo
1 CONC ry. The journal contained five articles, a book review and an account o
1 CONC f the proceedings of the Society, which included talks during the winte
1 CONC r sessions and summer visits to historic places.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Society continued in existence for a few more years but eventually p
1 CONC etered out in 1953. Its dissolution was a serious loss to the cultural l
1 CONC ife of Limerick. Since that time much good work has been done by the Tho
1 CONC mond Archaeological Society, the local press and inidividuals in the pro
1 CONC motion of he study of local history.
1 CONT 
1 CONT This journal and the re-formed Old Limerick Society wish to take up, con
1 CONC tinue and expand on the work of the 1940s group. We hope our readers wil
1 CONC l find an immediate sense of the past and its people in these pages. W
1 CONC e hope they will find this sense in pictures and articales on the buildi
1 CONC ngs, streets and waterways of the city, on the fields and farms of the c
1 CONC ountry - and the workers who lived and laboured on them through the cent
1 CONC uries. This journal will attempt to chart some of the real-life experien
1 CONC ces of Limerick and its people."

0 @N0535@ NOTE The baptism record lists Mary Hannon as the mother.
1 CONT 
1 CONT It's possible  that there was a mistake in this record, putting Mary ins
1 CONC tead Bridget as the mother, given that
1 CONT 
1 CONT 1)  The Ellen Conway in this family tree would have been born in the 185
1 CONC 0's in Fedamore
1 CONT 2) There does not appear to have been any other records of baptisms of c
1 CONC hildren of Thomas Conway & Mary Hannon in Fedamore
1 CONT 3) There does not appear to have been any  records of baptisms of Elle
1 CONC n of Thomas Conway & Bridget Hannon in Fedamore
0 @N0536@ NOTE According to family history Dave Clohessy came from Tankardstown an
1 CONC d that he and his family later lived in Fanningstown. I am presuming tha
1 CONC t they lived in Fanningstown from the time of their marriage. As far a
1 CONC s the evidence goes, John was baptised in 1854 in Fedamore, suggesting t
1 CONC hat the family was living in Fanningstown since before that time.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In the 1901 Census Dave is in Ballinamona with Dan Ryan's family. I am p
1 CONC resuming that he had moved to  Ballinamona permanently.

0 @N0644@ NOTE According to John Grenham [ https://www.johngrenham.com/browse/retr
1 CONC ieve_text.php?text_contentid=66 ] -
1 CONT 
1 CONT "From the 1820s to the 1840s a complex process of reform attempted to st
1 CONC andardise the basis of local taxation in Ireland. The first steps were t
1 CONC o map and fix administrative boundaries through the Ordnance Survey an
1 CONC d the associated Boundary Commission. The next step was to assess the pr
1 CONC oductive capacity of all property in the country in a thoroughly unifor
1 CONC m way. Richard Griffith, a geologist based in Dublin, became Boundary Co
1 CONC mmissioner in 1825 and Commissioner of Valuation in 1827. The results o
1 CONC f his great survey, the Primary	Valuation of Ireland, were published bet
1 CONC ween 1847 and 1864. The valuation is arranged by county, barony, Poor La
1 CONC w Union, civil parish and townland, and it lists every landholder and ev
1 CONC ery householder in Ireland. Apart from townland address and householder'
1 CONC s name, the particulars given are:
1 CONT 
1 CONT name of the person from whom the property was leased ('immediate lessor'
1 CONC );
1 CONT description of the property;
1 CONT acreage;
1 CONT valuation.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The only directly useful family information supplied is in areas wher
1 CONC e a surname was particularly common. The surveyors often adopted the tra
1 CONC ditional Irish practice of using the father's first name to distinguis
1 CONC h between individuals of the same name, so that 'John Reilly (James)' i
1 CONC s the son of James, while 'John Reilly (Michael)' is the son of Michael
1 CONC . For similar reasons, occupations are also sometimes used to tell 'Joh
1 CONC n Ryan (weaver)' from 'John Ryan (farmer)'. Copies of Griffith's Valuati
1 CONC on are widely available in major libraries and record offices, both on m
1 CONC icrofiche and in their original published form. A free online version i
1 CONC s at www.askaboutireland.ie.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT The valuation was never intended as a census substitute, and if the 185
1 CONC 1 census had survived it would have little genealogical significance. A
1 CONC s things stand, however, it gives the only detailed guide to where in Ir
1 CONC eland people lived in the middle of the nineteenth century and to what p
1 CONC roperty they occupied. In addition, a huge quantity of material was prod

1 CONC 4 on his World War I registration card in 1918.
1 CONT 
1 CONT There are no records of Michael Keene Ambrose living with the Ambrose fa
1 CONC mily as a child in the US Census.
1 CONT 
1 CONT All of the above suggests to me that Keane Matthew Ambrose went missin

1 CONC een August 1939 and April 1942 as Michael Keene Ambrose.

1 CONC e 27th August as their date of birth suggests that they are the same per

1 CONT PRIEST LOSES THE BEQUEST.
1 CONT Katie McGinty Was Very Ill When
1 CONT She Made Her Will.
1 CONT 
1 CONT It was decided by a jury in Judge H. Slover's division of the circuit co
1 CONC urt yesterday that Katie McGinty was too ill to know what she was doin
1 CONC g when she made her will bequeathing all of her property to the Rev. A
1 CONC . G. Clohessy, pastor of St. Joseph's church, Nineteenth and Harrison st
1 CONC reets, and that the will should be set aside and the property given to h
1 CONC er blood relations.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Miss McGinty served as housekeeper for Father Clohessy for fourteen cons
1 CONC ecutive years prior to the illness, which, on January 26, 1907, caused h
1 CONC er death. She was paid $2.50 a week, and out of this she saved, in the f
1 CONC ourteen years,, $1,128. The money was kept in the Fidelity Trust Company
1 CONC . A few days before her death in St. Margaret's hospital, she called Fat
1 CONC her Cloheesy in and asked him to accept the money. He refused to accep
1 CONC t it. Then she made a will, in his presence, leaving everything to him
1 CONC , after he should expend $25 for her funeral and gravestone and $200 fo
1 CONC r masses to be said for her soul. The funeral was held, the headstone er
1 CONC ected and the masses were said. Then when Father Clohessy probated the w
1 CONC ill, James McGinty, a brother of the dead woman, brought the action in t
1 CONC he circuit court.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Miss McGinty left no property other than the $1,128, excepting her cloth
1 CONC ing and personal effects. The residue of the estate will be divided amon
1 CONC g James, Patrick and Dennis McGinty, three brothers in Kansas City, an
1 CONC d seven nephews and nieces in St. Louis.

1 CONT PRIEST ENTITLED TO LEGACY.
1 CONT Will of Katie McGinty is Held Valid
1 CONT by a Jury.
1 CONT 
1 CONT At the second trial of the suit of the brothers of Katie McGinty to brea
1 CONC k her will, by which she gave all of her property to Father Andrew G. Cl
1 CONC ohessy of St. Joseph's church, the jury last evening found that the wil
1 CONC l was valid and that the priest is entitled to the money. The verdict i
1 CONC n the first trial, three months ago, was in favor of the brothers. The s
1 CONC econd trial was in Judge E. E. Porterfield's division of the circuit cou
1 CONC rt.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Katie McGinty was employed for fourteen years prior to her death in St
1 CONC . Margaret's hospital in January, 1907, as a domestic in the parish hous
1 CONC e at 1007 East Nineteenth street. She began service at $2 a week, was ad
1 CONC vanced to $6, and out of her wages saved $1,161. The day before her deat
1 CONC h she summoned to her bedside Father Clohessy, for whom she had worked t
1 CONC he many years, and asked him to accept her earnings. He refused. Later
1 CONC , while he was absent, she drew up a will, giving it all to him.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The priest had spent all but $200 of the $1,161 before the suit was brou
1 CONC ght by Jim McGinty and Patrick McGinty and the children of George and Be
1 CONC rnard McGinty, Katie's brothers. He devoted $400 to a funeral, $75 fo
1 CONC r a lot in St. Mary's cemetery, $260 for the gravestone and $200 gave t
1 CONC o other priests for the saying of mass for the repose of her soul.

1 CONC atrick:
1 CONT 
1 CONT Baptisms -
1 CONT John - 21/9/1830 in St. John's, Co. Limerick, Ireland
1 CONT Ellen - 4/6/1833 in St. John's, Co. Limerick, Ireland
1 CONT Anne - 6/4/1839 in St. John's, Co. Limerick, Ireland
1 CONT Robert - 12/11/1843 in St. John's, Co. Limerick, Ireland
1 CONT 
1 CONT There is also a record of Patrick Conway in the same family being baptis
1 CONC ed on 22 Jun 1836.
1 CONT 
1 CONT St. John's parish is in Limerick city. The above can be verified as bapt
1 CONC isms of children of John Conway and Margaret Hall from the parish record
1 CONC s online (there are also a few baptisms of children of John Conway and M
1 CONC argaret Hall from 1823 onwards in the neighbouring parish of St. Mary, t
1 CONC hough Thomas is not apparent).
1 CONT 
1 CONT Mary Looby's information also has it that came from Pallas Grean, whic
1 CONC h is about 20 kilometers from St. John's parish. Normally baptisms are p
1 CONC erformed in the parish in which the family lives, so the information abo
1 CONC ut the baptisms may be incorrect.
1 CONT 
1 CONT It is possible that Thomas Conway (with or without the rest of the famil
1 CONC y) moved to Pallas Grean when he was a teenager, or later or that the fa
1 CONC mily lived in Pallas Grean but for some reason had their children baptis
1 CONC ed in the city.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Alternatively it could be that someone found that the baptism records i
1 CONC n St. John's parish matched some of the information on the family and in
1 CONC correctly concluded that those records refer to people in this family tr
1 CONC ee. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Without knowing why those baptisms are thought to apply to our family i
1 CONC t is difficult to know if the information is correct or not. Until I fin
1 CONC d out that those records should apply, I shall err on the side of cautio
1 CONC n leave out the children for which there is no other evidence of a conne
1 CONC ction to the family. By the same token I will also exclude Margaret Hall

1 CONT Between 1890 and 1920, among the highest tonnage of ships were leaving B
1 CONC ritish ports bound for North America. Many passengers were emigrants fro
1 CONC m Britain, Ireland and Europe. European emigrants bound for America ente
1 CONC red the United Kingdom because travelling steerage was less expensive fr
1 CONC om a British port than from a port in Europe. The shipping companies imp
1 CONC osed restrictions on passengers registering; passengers had to have Brit
1 CONC ish residency of six weeks to qualify. Many passengers too impatient t
1 CONC o qualify for residency changed their names to avoid detection.

1 CONC y Sehc, but there are two records that suggest that she may have been ma
1 CONC rried to Harry J Lehr.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Esther appears inthe 1925 New York state census as Esther Ambrose livin
1 CONC g with her parents. She must have married some time after the census wa
1 CONC s taken in 1925.
1 CONT 
1 CONT There is a record of the marriage of Esther L Ambrose to Harry J Lehr i
1 CONC n Brookly in 1926.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In the 1930 census there is a record of Harry J Lehr and his wife Elizab
1 CONC eth L who were four years married in 1930. Elizabeth's age in the censu
1 CONC s is approximately what Esther's would have been, and her birth place (N
1 CONC ew York) and the birth places of her parents (both from Ireland) match E
1 CONC sther's exactly.
1 CONT 
1 CONT It's possible that the enumerator mistakenly recorded Esther's name as E
1 CONC lizabeth. Also the information that Harry's surname was Sehc may have ar
1 CONC isen from an incorrect transcription of Lehr, the names being similar wh
1 CONC en written by hand.

1 CONC e-indexed rather than name-indexed, meaning that to find your ancestor
1 CONC s you had to check through pages of records and see if your ancestor wa
1 CONC s somewhere on the image. The original documents are held by the Genera
1 CONC l Register Office (GRO). By using the information found within this inde
1 CONC x, you can request the original document of your ancestor’s birth. You w
1 CONC ill need to register with the GRO site and pay a small fee.

1 CONT What can these records tell me?
1 CONT In each you record, you will find a transcript and for those records bef
1 CONC ore 1984, you can also view the original index. The birth, marriage an
1 CONC d death records from 1984 onwards were recorded in a computer database o
1 CONC nly so there is no original image for records post-1984. Each transcrip

1 CONT About England & Wales, Civil Registration Birth Index, 1837-1915
1 CONT 
1 CONT Country wide civil registration of births, marriages and deaths commence
1 CONC d on 1 July 1837 in England and Wales. Registration took place at loca
1 CONC l civil registrars who in turn reported to the Registrar General at th
1 CONC e General Register Office (GRO) in London. This national index to vita
1 CONC l records is an essential source of genealogical information for famil
1 CONC y historians.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Since the original birth, marriage and death registers are not open to t
1 CONC he public, access to the information on one of these certificates is don
1 CONC e by first searching the national birth, marriage and death indexes, tha
1 CONC t have been created by the GRO for this purpose. The indexes for the thr
1 CONC ee events are divided into volumes by year following which entries are l
1 CONC isted alphabetically. Once an entry in one of the indexes is found, yo
1 CONC u are then able to use that information to order of copy of a death, mar
1 CONC riage or birth certificate from the GRO. Information that can be obtaine
1 CONC d from the birth index includes:
1 CONT 
1 CONT     Full name of child
1 CONT 
1 CONT     Maiden name of mother
1 CONT 
1 CONT     Month and year of registration
1 CONT 
1 CONT     Registration district (each county in England and Wales was divide
1 CONC d up into registration districts; jurisdictions are organized and appea
1 CONC r as they existed at the time the record was created)
1 CONT 
1 CONT     Inferred county (the county is inferred based on what counties the r
1 CONC egistration district covered)
1 CONT 
1 CONT     Volume number

1 CONC ganized the permissions and tools necessary to enable thousands of volun
1 CONC teers to convert to electronic text, and publish online, searchable inde
1 CONC xes to the civil registrations in England and Wales. Because of the natu
1 CONC re of the index you will note that not all of the fields have been index

0 @N1024@ NOTE Why are Mary Cusack's Foley family not included in this tree?
1 CONT 
1 CONT The tree I received from Jeremiah Russell has Mary Cusack of Trough, Cla
1 CONC re married to a Foley (first name not known) with the following children
1 CONC :
1 CONT 
1 CONT Jimmy
1 CONT Bridget
1 CONT Hannie
1 CONT Mary Anne b1873
1 CONT 
1 CONT The 1901 census has a Foley family in Lickadoon, Roxborough, Limerick wi
1 CONC th children whose names are James(26), Hannie(25) and Bridget(24). The f
1 CONC ather Thomas is a widower. There is no Mary Anne in the household, howev
1 CONC er there is a record of Mary Anne Foley of Lickadoon, whose father was T
1 CONC homas, marrying in 1895.
1 CONT 
1 CONT There is a record of Thomas and Mary marrying in 1868, and of Mary dyin
1 CONC g in 1878, the year after Bridget was born.
1 CONT 
1 CONT There are records of the children being born in Lickadoon in the 1870s t
1 CONC o Thomas and Mary Foley, in the same order as they appear in the censu
1 CONC s (plus Mary Anne in 1873).
1 CONT 
1 CONT It seems likely that the Foley family in the tree is the same family i
1 CONC n the census. However Mary Foley's maiden name in these records is Black
1 CONC well, not Cusack. Assuming that Mary did not change her name from Cusac
1 CONC k to Blackwell, it would seem that this Foley family and their decendant
1 CONC s should not be connected to Mary Cusack. Without further information i
1 CONC t is impossible to know if Mary Cusack was married to a Foley or not.
