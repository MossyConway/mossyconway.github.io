            <strong>Obituary</strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            William E. “Bill” Hannan, 95, of Christopher Heights, South Main Street, Attleboro, a loving father, grandfather and brother, passed peacefully on Wednesday, April 1, 2009 at the Philip Hulitar Hospice in Providence. He was the beloved husband of the late Isabelle B. (Driscoll) Hannan.
           </p>
           <p>
            Born in Attleboro on April 11, 1913, Bill was a son of the late Thomas J. and Mary (Keane) Hannan. He was a graduate of Attleboro High School, Class of 1930 and later earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Boston College, Class of 1935. In the eighth grade Bill was awarded a Bronze Medal in a state wide writing competition for his essay on the USS Constitution, also known as “Old Ironsides.” This sparked a lifelong interest in journalism.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bill worked several jobs during the late 30’s and early 40’s including working at the Railway Express Station in Attleboro, a driver for Coca Cola Company, he also worked under Ray Brennan at Jeweled Cross in North Attleboro and was a clerk at Cloutier’s Market and DeLitta’s Market both in Attleboro. In the 1920’s Bill was a carrier for the then Attleboro Sun.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the early 1940’s Bill wrote special interest stories and freelance articles for the Attleboro Sun. His first full time newspaper position came in 1949 when he was a City Reporter at the Stamford Advocate in Stamford, CT. Bill was assigned to cover many sporting events which included the Stamford team’s victory in the 1951 Little League World Series game in Williamsport, PA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sports was Bill’s passion and he was in attendance to see Don Larsen’s World Series Perfect Game and was also at the World Series game when Willy Mays made the famous over the shoulder ‘catch’ still marveled by many today. He also watched Babe Ruth play in an exhibition game in Attleboro.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1962 Bill joined the Leominster Enterprise in Leominster, MA as the Managing Editor. He became involved in many town activities and found time to coach his two boys in Little League. In 1968 he joined the Evening Sentinel in Ansonia, CT as an Editor. Bill joined the Attleboro Sun in 1970 as the Editorial Page Editor and eventually took on the role of Business Editor. He officially retired in 1978 but took on assignments to cover the leisure scene in the Attleboro area that included reporting on Lion Club and the Elk’s Club activities, restaurant and theater reviews both locally and in the Providence area. He continued writing his weekly column in the Sun Chronicle until the age of 94 when he retired. His columns centered on his memories of the Attleboro area and about the people who made those memories come to life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bill was an avid sports fan and enjoyed watching his grandchildren partake in such activities. He was also a loyal follower of the Boston Red Sox, the New York Giants and his beloved Boston College Eagles. He kept active at the Attleboro YMCA into his 90’s. Bill was a Past Grand Knight of the Attleboro Chapter of the Knights of Columbus, Fourth Degree, President of the Stamford Little League, a Trustee of the Attleboro Public Library, a communicant of St. John the Evangelist Church, a member of the Board of Directors of the Attleboro Area Mental Health Center, an Honorary Member of the Attleboro Lion and Rotary Clubs, a former member of the Board of Directors on the Attleboro Council on Aging, was involved early in the Attleboro recycling program, early involvement at the Attleboro Historical Museum, a member of the Attleboro Toastmaster’s Club, a member of the Larson Senior Center Community Players and was also inducted into the New England Press Association Hall of Fame. Bill was also the recipient of the Paul Harris Fellowship Award given by the Attleboro Rotary Club.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Hannan is survived by his three children: Timothy Hannan and his wife Nancy of South Windsor, CT, Terence Hannan and his wife Sherry of Plainville and Maureen Collins of Cumberland; nine loving grandchildren: Timothy Hannan, Casey Hannan, Neal Hannan, Matthew Hannan, Kyle Hannan, Tracey Hannan, John Collins, Ryan Collins and Christine Collins; a sister: Dorothy Cunningham of Attleboro; a brother: John Hannan of Attleboro; and many nieces and nephews.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was the beloved brother of the late Thomas J. Hannan, Jr. and Mary E. Brown.
           </p>
