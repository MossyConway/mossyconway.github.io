Thomas was first-cousin-once-removed to Thomas Conway [1900 - 1980] and his sister Annie was married to Thomas Cusack [1863 - 1925] who was an uncle of Bridie Clohessy [1904 - 1986]. The memoir details Thomas's life growing up in Limerick and Dublin, and he names many of his relatives and where they lived. I have used this information in combination with baptism and land records to find the parents of Bridget Hannan [1830 - 1903] and her aunts, uncles and other relatives. The memoir can be found in the Download section.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mossyconway.github.io/ConwayClohessy/4</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 10:20:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Added Noonan, Foley and Fitzgerald families</title><description>Originally I left out part of the tree because I had found a discrepancy between the information I had received on the Cusacks and the records (avilable online) for some of those people. I chose to leave that part of the tree out until I had a better understanding, because it wasn't clear where the diffeences were coming from. I can now add the relevant people to the tree. Thanks to Jerry Russell and Hugh Sweeney for the information.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mossyconway.github.io/ConwayClohessy/3</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Mar 2018 11:02:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>New Year, New People</title><description>Added James Sullivan, Clothilde Cusack, Agnes Gleeson, Bridie Gleeson, Eily Gleeson, Kathleen Geary, Bridget Ryan, May Ryan, Burdis Redford, Luke Hartigan,</description><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mossyconway.github.io/ConwayClohessy/2</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 12:37:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Move Along Please, Nothing To See Here (Yet!)</title><description>The web site has only just been published, so no updates yet, give it some time.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mossyconway.github.io/ConwayClohessy/1</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
