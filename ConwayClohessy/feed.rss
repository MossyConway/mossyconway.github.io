I chose to leave that part of the tree out until I had a better understanding, because it wasn't clear where the diffeences were coming from. I can now add the relevant people to the tree. Thanks to Jerry Russell and Hugh Sweeney for the information.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mossyconway.github.io/ConwayClohessy/3</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Mar 2018 11:02:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>New Year, New People</title><description>Added James Sullivan, Clothilde Cusack, Agnes Gleeson, Bridie Gleeson, Eily Gleeson, Kathleen Geary, Bridget Ryan, May Ryan, Burdis Redford, Luke Hartigan,</description><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mossyconway.github.io/ConwayClohessy/2</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 12:37:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Move Along Please, Nothing To See Here (Yet!)</title><description>The web site has only just been published, so no updates yet, give it some time.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mossyconway.github.io/ConwayClohessy/1</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
