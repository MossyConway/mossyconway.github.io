       Purpose and Scope
      </h2>
      <span>There are a number of websites that people use to create and share their family trees, like <a href="https://ancestry.co.uk">Ancestry</a>. To see someone
              else's tree on those sites you would usually need a subscription.
              That is how those sites make money, which is fair enough. But to
              access all of your families' trees, you'd have to subscribe to all the
              sites that your family members are using, which is a barrier to sharing information.</span>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span>The purpose of <strong>this</strong> site is to share my
              version of the family tree, no registration or subscription
              needed. You can download a copy of the tree (<a href="#sharing">see
                below</a>) which can imported into most genealogy websites and
              apps. Or you can copy information into your tree or send me
              submissions and corrections.<br/>
<br/>
           This tree includes only blood
            relatives of Thomas Conway &amp; Bridie Clohessy, and partners of
            their blood relatives. Information about the family of a partner of
            a blood relative may be included as a note on that partner.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="public" style="display:block">
           Living people, and the recently deceased, are excluded from this site for the sake of their privacy and security. There are likely to be several people who are excluded because I don't know if they're still alive or not.
            </span>
<h2 id="individual"> The Personal Page </h2>
            This is the web page you'll see when you're looking at the details
            of a specific person. <br/>
<br/>
<span>There is a Personal page for each person on the tree. The
              Personal page shows events from the life of the person in
              question, such as births, marriages, deaths, residences etc, and
              in some cases stories about that person. See <em>Figure 1</em>.</span><br/>
<br/>
              For people for whom I do not have a date of birth I have estimated their year of birth based on the year they were married or the year of the birth of their first child. For people for whom I do not have a date of death I have estimated their year of death based on the assumption that they did not live past 120 years. Those estimated dates are prefixed with the words "estimated before..."<br/>
<br/>
            The Personal page also lists a person's <br/>
<ul>
<li> Parents </li>
<li> Sibings </li>
<li> Spouse </li>
<li> Children </li>
</ul>
<br/>
            You can click on the names on those lists to go to the named
            person's page.            <br/>
<br/>
            There is <strong>no</strong> big visual family tree on this site
            showing how everybody is connected, but each Personal page has a
            diagram of that person's direct ancestors (parents, grandparents,
            etc) showing up to five generations. See <em> Figure 2</em> . You can click on the names on that tree to go to each person's page.
            <br/>
<br/>
<strong id="individual_sources"> Sources </strong> <br/>
<span>We add <em>events</em> to our ancestors on a family tree,
              such as birth, marriage, death, burial information, etc.
              These events come from a <em>sources</em> such as
              <ul>
<li>birth, marriage, death certificates</li>
<li>military records</li>
<li>census records</li>
<li>family bibles</li>
<li>personal journals, etc.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
              The events create a time line of information about that person
              such as<br/>
<ul>
<li>where born</li>
<li>occupation</li>
<li>where married</li>
<li>where they resided</li>
<li>any military involvement etc.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
              Sources confirm WHERE the specific facts come from. In this tree
              each event has one or more source <em>references</em> (see <em>Figure
                1</em>). Click on the link in the <em>Sources</em> column to
              see details of the source information for the associated event. In the example
              above clicking on <strong>2a</strong> in the <em>Sources</em>
              column will take you to a source reference showing details of the
              baptism record, including a transcript and a link to an online
              image of the record.<br/>
<br/>
              Each person also has one or more main source references, shown as
              links beside the person's name on their page (see <em>Figure 1</em>).
              Those references show how that person is connected to the family
              tree. For example a marriage record shows how a person has married
              into the family, or a birth record shows that a person is a child
              of people known to be in the family.<br/>
<br/>
              All source references relating to a person are listed at the end of their Personal
              page. You can find where the information for an event (or person)
              originated by checking the sources. This can be helpful if
              information in this tree conflicts with your own.<br/>
<br/>
             Most source references include  a link to a webpage. Some of those webpages can only be accessed if you are registered to the website and logged in. Others require that you also have paid a subscription to the website, in which case the link is prefixed with "$ubscription only".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
              Sometimes information passes to me without sources. In those cases
              I have listed the person from whom I received the information as
              the source. That's right folks, if you don't have a source for
              your information then <strong>you</strong> get the <s>blame</s>
              credit!</span><br/>

<h2 id="idiosyncrasies"> Idiosyncrasies of Irish Genealogy </h2>
<strong id="idiosync_age"> Age </strong> <br/>
            People in Ireland didn't have a reason to know how old they were
            before the start of the Old Age Pension in 1909. They would often
            under report their age. Usually the recorded ages of children were
            correct. In my experience from reading the records, people would
            start under-reporting their age in early adulthood. The inaccuracy
            of reported age tended to increase as they grew older. Discrepancies
            also occurred when one person reported another's age. In the case of
            a record of death the informant might give an estimate of the
            deceased's age. This results in a disproportionate number of older
            people dying at ages of 70, 75, 80 etc.. <br/>
<br/>
<strong id="idiosync_oapcensus"> The Old Age Pension and the 1911
              Census </strong> <br/>
            The Old Age Pensions Act 1908 introduced a pension for 'eligible'
            people aged 70 and over. It came into law in January 1909 across
            England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. This gave people a reason to
            know what age they were, and a reason to pretend that they older
            than they were. There are many cases where people who
            under-exaggerated their age for the 1901 Census then
            over-exaggerated their age in 1911. In one case a man who claimed to
            be 30 in 1901 aged 25 years by 1911. Fortunately for him, his wife
            only aged 10 years in the same length of time! On the 1911 census
            form he wrote "50" to start with, then crossed out the "0" and wrote
            in another "5", just to be sure. <br/>
<br/>
<strong id="idiosync_baptismbirth">Baptism and Birth Dates</strong>
<br/>
            There were fines for late registration of births (and deaths). To
            avoid the fine sometimes the family registered the event as having
            happened at a later date. This means that sometimes parents baptised
            their child before it was officially born. In such cases I have
            estimated that the birth happened sometime in the week before the
            baptism. <br/>
<br/>
<strong id="idiosync_names">Name Variations</strong> <br/>
<span>When you're searching for genealogical records it's important to know that a person's name can be presented differently in different records. Though literacy rates in Ireland improved dramatically during the second half of the 19th century, many people were illiterate. Priests and other record keepers would have been expected to know (or decide) how to spell names. This is one reason why a peron's name might have speelling variations across records.<br/>
<br/>
Records almost always use the formal version of a person's first name. Many 19th century parish records are in Latin, using the "Latin-ised" form of Christian names (surnames are always in English). In Latin the name changes to indicate son/daughter of, bride of, etc. For example "John son of John" becomes "Johannes, filius Johannis". Click <a href="http://www.from-ireland.net/irish-names/latin-names-in-english/">here</a> for a list of names tranlsted from Latin to English. In some cases there are many ways one name can be formalised. For example, a woman called Johanna, calling herself Hannie maybe reported in different records  as Johanna, Hannie, Hanoria, Hanora. Some names do not have obvious Latin equivalents. For example Jane might be recorded as Johanna or Janita.<br/>
<br/>
If a child died it a later child in the same family would sometimes be given the same name. So it's not unusual to see two birth or baptism records for what appears to be the same child in different years.<br/>
<br/>
Most parish records only list the names of the people involved, though some include a paragraph formally declaring the ceremony in Latin. For consitency the "transcriptions" of parish records in this tree list only the relevant information from the record, with Latin names translated into English.<br/>
<br/>
Wildcards can help with name variation on some sites like <a href="https://ancestry.co.uk">Ancestry</a>. If you put "McC*l*gh" in the last name field on the search page it'll match "McCallagh", "McCullough", "McCollagh" etc. The wildcard "*" matches any number of letters. This works on <a href="https://ancestry.co.uk">Ancestry</a>, <a href="https://findmypast.ie">FindMyPast</a> and <a href="https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie">irishgenealogy.ie</a>.<br/></span>

<h2 id="bmds"> Genealogical Beasts and Where to Find Them </h2>
            Every time you find a new person to add to your tree you'll want to
            find their birth (or baptism), marriage, death and census records.
            Birth, marriage and census records in particular are good for
            finding connections to "new" relatives, e.g. a birth record will
            have the names of both parents. <br/>
<br/>
            If you know when and where a relative was born, you can use their
            birth record to find their parents. Knowing the names of both
            parents will help you to find a marriage record. A civil marriage
            record will give you the residence, occupation and fathers' names of
            both parties. The date of marriage helps to establish when to start
            looking for birth records for that couple's children. Catholic
            weddings usually take place in the parish church of the bride’s
            family, which is usually the parish in which the bride was born.
            This is a good first guess to where to look for the bride's birth or
            baptism records. <br/>

<strong id="bmds_parish">Parish Records</strong> <br/>
<span>Images of the Catholic parish records of baptisms and
              marriages can be browsed at the <a href="http://registers.nli.ie/">NLI's
                Catholic Parish Registers</a>. The <a href="../src/7/6/c36090364537103d667.html">Source
                page for the collection</a> shows how to use Ancestry or
              FindMyPast to search the registers. There are burial registers for
              some parishes, but not for most. The start dates for the registers
              vary from parish to parish and the NLI has parish register records
              up to 1880, with gaps. Commerical sites, such as <a href="http://www.rootsireland.ie/">Roots
                Ireland</a> have parish records later than 1880. To see what
              records are available for the parish you're interest in, and where
              to find them, see John Grenham's <a href="https://www.johngrenham.com/places/rcmap_index.php">Catholic
                parishes in Ireland</a>.</span> <br/>
<br/>
<strong id="bmds_civil">Civil Records</strong> <br/>
<span>Civil registration of births, marriages and deaths began for
              Catholics in 1864. Those records can searched on the <a href="http://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/civil-search.jsp">Irish
                Genealogy site</a>. The civil records are organised by
              registration district. An index of the civil registration
              districts by country and by district can be found on the Source
              pages for Civil <a href="../src/d/e/d68fb2a4378fb4a1d0f5c945ed.html">Births</a><a>,
              </a><a href="../src/f/f/d68c89eb6cb5b14e962929bbdff.html">Marriages</a>,
              <a href="../src/b/b/d68c651eb7e6bf699dd9cb5acbb.html">Deaths</a>.
              This guide can be used to see which districts are in a particular
              county, or given a district name, the county (or counties) to
              which it belongs.</span> <br/>
<br/>
<strong id="bmds_census">Censuses</strong> <br/>
            The census records can be an excellent resource for expanding your
            tree. You may be able to find an ancestor <b>and</b> their
            siblings, parents or their spouse, if you know the name, location
            and approximate age of a person in your family who was alive in
            during one of the surviving censuses. <br/>
<br/>
<span>The censuses for 1901 and 1911 in Ireland are available online
              and can be searched <a href="http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/">here</a>.
              Previous censuses were destroyed though some fragments and records
              relating to those censuses also exist. There was a census taken in
              1926, which under current legislation cannot be made public before
              2026.</span> <br/>

<h2 id="sharing"> Sharing a Family Tree </h2>
            You can share your family tree by exporting (or downloading) a
            GEDCOM file from your genealogy website or software. GEDCOM is a
            text file that contains the information from your tree. Most
            genealogy websites/apps/software will allow you to export or import
            a GEDCOM file. You can download a GEDCOM file of the tree on this
            site from the <em><a href="download.html" title="Download page">Download</a></em>
            page. <br/>
<br/>
           Note that some of the information in this tree has been provided by people who have not given sources for every piece of information. In those cases I have given their name as the source. This may make it difficult to verify some of the facts in this tree, which is something you should do before incorporating new information into your own tree.<br/>
<br/>
            Here are instructions for downloading a GEDCOM file from (or
            uploading to) some of the more popular genealogy websites: <br/>

<strong> N.B. </strong> Your GEDCOM file may contain sensitive
            information, e.g. details of living people. Your genealogy website
            would only share that information with people you trust. Be careful
            who you share that GEDCOM file with. <br/>
<br/>
<strong id="sharing_gedcomlimits"> GEDCOM Limitations </strong> <br/>
            The GEDCOM specification flexibility allows it to support many ways
            of encoding data. This flexibility means that some genealogy
            programs do not import all the data from a GEDCOM file. All the
            names and the dates should remain intact, but some the other
            information may get lost, like the sources or other notes. <br/>
<br/>
<strong id="sharing_gedcomalternatives"> Alternatives to GEDCOM </strong>

<h2 id="publicdiscussion"> Public Discussion of this Website and
              Tree </h2>
            I have started a thread at [url thing] so that anyone who wants to
            can discuss this website / family tree in an open forum. That will
            allow people to say what they want to say without limiting the
            discussion to me and them. Also it will provide a public record of
            the discussion. It doesn't matter which website we use and there's
            nothing stopping people from using other websites for this purpose.
            I chose [website name] because it's popular and is likely to remain
            operational for a while. <br/>

<h2 id="grampsref"> Gramps </h2>
<span>
<a href="http://gramps-project.org/"><em>Gramps</em></a> is a genealogical program I use to organise my version of the
            family tree on my home computer. It is also the program that created
            this website from that family tree data. If you are using 
              <a href="http://gramps-project.org/"><em>Gramps</em></a> yourself you can download a copy of the tree in Gramps XML
            format from the 
              <a href="download.html" title="Download page"><em>Download</em></a> page and import the file into

<br/>
             While I welcome suggestions for improvements to the website,
            please be aware that what the website does, and how the website
            works is determined by <em>

<h2 id="errors"> Errors and Omissions </h2>
            For your amusement there are several errors to be found on this
            website. The categories of error include, but are not limited to: <br/>
<br/>
<span>
<em>Typographical</em> and <em>Logical</em> <br/>
<em>Environmental</em>, <em>Instrumental</em> and <em>Statistical</em>
              (Type I and Type II)<br/>
<em>Net Errors</em>, <em>Gross Errors</em>, <em>Cute Errors</em><br/>
<em>Errors of Omission</em> and <em>Errors of Commission</em><br/>
<em>Relative Errors</em> and <em>Errors of Relatives</em><br/>
</span> <br/>
<span> There are no prizes for finding errors, but if you do find
              something that I should fix then please send an email to <a class="email"></a>
<script language="javascript">
      function myEmail() {{{{
      		return "abfrcnz-snzvyl@lnubb.pb.hx".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g,function(c){{{{return String.fromCharCode((c<="Z"?90:122)>=(c=c.charCodeAt(0)+13)?c:c-26);}}}});

      [].forEach.call(emails, function(email) {{{{
		email['href']="mailto:"+myEmail();
		email.text=myEmail();
	}}}});
     </script> and I'll fix it (or I'll start a heated e-mail exchange in which
              I will convince you that I was right in the first place). Note
              though that it is often not enough just to say that something is
              wrong, e.g. saying that "John Smith wasn't born on that date"
              isn't particularly helpful. You should normally also say <strong>why</strong>
              you think something's wrong and if possible <strong>what</strong>
              the correction should be. </span> </span></span></span>
