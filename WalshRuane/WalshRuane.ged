4 CONT Descriptive Particulars
4 CONT 
4 CONT These Lands are situate within two-and-a-half miles of Claremorris, a Po
4 CONC st, Fair, and Market Town, fifteen and-a-half miles of Tuam, and twenty-

4 CONT The soil consists of a warm, friable loam - well adapted for green crop
4 CONC , tillage, or a sheep-walk. Part is light and shallow; but could be muc
4 CONC h improved by deep tillage, manuring and liming - all of which could eco
4 CONC nomically done, as the lands are free from rocks or stones; amd being wa
4 CONC rm and dry can be labored at any season; and the expensive process of dr
4 CONC aining required on other soils is unnecessary.
4 CONT There is a daily conveyance between Claremorris and Athenry.

5 CONT By the Receiver's account, passed 1st July 1851, it appears that the por
5 CONC tion of these lands now in the hands of tenants, produces (after conside
5 CONC rable abatements having been made) an annual rent of £542 0s. 10d. exclu
5 CONC sive of the untenanted portion which appears to amount to 486a. 0r. 29p
5 CONC . statute measure as appears by the last column of the summary. And, alt
5 CONC hough, the present valuation of the Estate is considerably under the ren
5 CONC ts payable by the Tenantry, yet thre Receiver, who has been over these l
5 CONC ands for the last seven years, states the rents to be fair and reasonabl
5 CONC e, some of the lettings have been made so lately as November, 1849. Th
5 CONC e Quit-rent affecting this property will be redeemed.

5 CONT DESCRIPTIVE PARTICULARS
5 CONT 
5 CONT These lands are for the most part good tillage soil and part bottom, ena
5 CONC ble of great improvement by a small expenditure in draining, and now aff
5 CONC ording good rough pasture, there is also a great quantity of veryapprova
5 CONC ble bog, and a large proportion (estimated at eighty acres) of the demen
5 CONC se is tastefully planted with useful and ornamental  timber, varying fro
5 CONC m twenty to thirty years growth, which tends much to beautify and shelte
5 CONC r the grounds. The house which is well sheltered and surrounded by neatl
5 CONC y planted pleasure grounds, containing shrubs of the chiocest kin, can
5 CONC , by some outlay be made a commodious residence.

1 CONT By the Receiver's account, passed 1st July 1851, it appears that the por

1 CONT These lands are for the most part good tillage soil and part bottom, ena
1 CONC ble of great improvement by a small expenditure in draining, and now aff
1 CONC ording good rough pasture, there is also a great quantity of veryapprova
1 CONC ble bog, and a large proportion (estimated at eighty acres) of the demen
1 CONC se is tastefully planted with useful and ornamental  timber, varying fro
1 CONC m twenty to thirty years growth, which tends much to beautify and shelte
1 CONC r the grounds. The house which is well sheltered and surrounded by neatl

1 CONT Descriptive Particulars
1 CONT 
1 CONT These Lands are situate within two-and-a-half miles of Claremorris, a Po
1 CONC st, Fair, and Market Town, fifteen and-a-half miles of Tuam, and twenty-
1 CONC nine miles of Athenry, where there is a Station of the Midland Great Rai
1 CONC lway.
1 CONT The soil consists of a warm, friable loam - well adapted for green crop
1 CONC , tillage, or a sheep-walk. Part is light and shallow; but could be muc
1 CONC h improved by deep tillage, manuring and liming - all of which could eco
1 CONC nomically done, as the lands are free from rocks or stones; amd being wa
1 CONC rm and dry can be labored at any season; and the expensive process of dr
1 CONC aining required on other soils is unnecessary.
1 CONT There is a daily conveyance between Claremorris and Athenry.

1 CONT           In order for you to be able to find records of your ancestor

1 CONT           (photographs) of the original record. An <em>index</em> will

1 CONT 
1 CONT "From the 1820s to the 1840s a complex process of reform attempted to st
1 CONC andardise the basis of local taxation in Ireland. The first steps were t
1 CONC o map and fix administrative boundaries through the Ordnance Survey an
1 CONC d the associated Boundary Commission. The next step was to assess the pr
1 CONC oductive capacity of all property in the country in a thoroughly unifor
1 CONC m way. Richard Griffith, a geologist based in Dublin, became Boundary Co
1 CONC mmissioner in 1825 and Commissioner of Valuation in 1827. The results o
1 CONC f his great survey, the Primary	Valuation of Ireland, were published bet
1 CONC ween 1847 and 1864. The valuation is arranged by county, barony, Poor La
1 CONC w Union, civil parish and townland, and it lists every landholder and ev
1 CONC ery householder in Ireland. Apart from townland address and householder'
1 CONC s name, the particulars given are:
1 CONT 
1 CONT name of the person from whom the property was leased ('immediate lessor'
1 CONC );
1 CONT description of the property;
1 CONT acreage;
1 CONT valuation.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The only directly useful family information supplied is in areas wher
1 CONC e a surname was particularly common. The surveyors often adopted the tra
1 CONC ditional Irish practice of using the father's first name to distinguis
1 CONC h between individuals of the same name, so that 'John Reilly (James)' i
1 CONC s the son of James, while 'John Reilly (Michael)' is the son of Michael
1 CONC . For similar reasons, occupations are also sometimes used to tell 'Joh
1 CONC n Ryan (weaver)' from 'John Ryan (farmer)'. Copies of Griffith's Valuati
1 CONC on are widely available in major libraries and record offices, both on m
1 CONC icrofiche and in their original published form. A free online version i
1 CONC s at www.askaboutireland.ie.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT The valuation was never intended as a census substitute, and if the 185
1 CONC 1 census had survived it would have little genealogical significance. A
1 CONC s things stand, however, it gives the only detailed guide to where in Ir
1 CONC eland people lived in the middle of the nineteenth century and to what p
1 CONC roperty they occupied. In addition, a huge quantity of material was prod
1 CONC uced both before publication and in subsequent revisions, making it poss
1 CONC ible in many cases to identify occupiers before the publication date an
1 CONC d to trace living descendants of those originally listed by Griffith. (S

0 @N0317@ NOTE From the Introduction of Vol. 1, December 1979:
1 CONT 
1 CONT "The Old Limerick Society was founded in November, 1943, with high hope
1 CONC s and ambitions. The aims of the Society were:
1 CONT 
1 CONT 1. To promote the study of the history and antiquities of Limerick.
1 CONT 2. To acquire and conserve local documents, books, plans, etc.
1 CONT 3. To create and foster an interest in everything pertaining to Old Lime
1 CONC rick, and thereby help to help to cultivate a better civic spirit.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Society also worked to preserve local monuments, buildings, document
1 CONC s, legends, ballads, etc.- which were in danger of being lost - and to r
1 CONC ecord and maintain sites of historic interest.
1 CONT In December 1946 the Society produced its first, and only, journal. Thi
1 CONC s magazine made a valuable contribution to the study of Limerick's histo
1 CONC ry. The journal contained five articles, a book review and an account o
1 CONC f the proceedings of the Society, which included talks during the winte
1 CONC r sessions and summer visits to historic places.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Society continued in existence for a few more years but eventually p
1 CONC etered out in 1953. Its dissolution was a serious loss to the cultural l
1 CONC ife of Limerick. Since that time much good work has been done by the Tho
1 CONC mond Archaeological Society, the local press and inidividuals in the pro
1 CONC motion of he study of local history.
1 CONT 
1 CONT This journal and the re-formed Old Limerick Society wish to take up, con
1 CONC tinue and expand on the work of the 1940s group. We hope our readers wil
1 CONC l find an immediate sense of the past and its people in these pages. W
1 CONC e hope they will find this sense in pictures and articales on the buildi
1 CONC ngs, streets and waterways of the city, on the fields and farms of the c
1 CONC ountry - and the workers who lived and laboured on them through the cent
1 CONC uries. This journal will attempt to chart some of the real-life experien
1 CONC ces of Limerick and its people."

1 CONT The city and county of Philadelphia were combined in 1854. In 1860, th
1 CONC e city passed a law requiring the Board of Health to register all marria
1 CONC ges. In 1885, Pennsylvania authorized the Orphans’ Court in each count
1 CONC y to register marriages. By 1885, all marriages were supposed to be lice
1 CONC nsed in Pennsylvania. The index entries are type written and arranged i
1 CONC n columns.

1 CONT Marriage records validate a spouse’s legal claim to property. Marriage l
1 CONC icenses grant permission for a marriage to be performed and replaced th
1 CONC e previous requirements to post banns or intentions. The index was creat
1 CONC ed to provide public officials with a quick and easy access to any speci
1 CONC fic marriage record.

1 CONT The National Archives website provides these interesting details:
1 CONT 
1 CONT Between 1890 and 1920, among the highest tonnage of ships were leaving B
1 CONC ritish ports bound for North America. Many passengers were emigrants fro
1 CONC m Britain, Ireland and Europe. European emigrants bound for America ente
1 CONC red the United Kingdom because travelling steerage was less expensive fr
1 CONC om a British port than from a port in Europe. The shipping companies imp
1 CONC osed restrictions on passengers registering; passengers had to have Brit
1 CONC ish residency of six weeks to qualify. Many passengers too impatient t
1 CONC o qualify for residency changed their names to avoid detection.

1 CONT 
1 CONT The Landed Estates Court “Rentals” are an important source for Irish fam
1 CONC ily history, as they provide extensive information about land occupatio
1 CONC n in the mid-nineteenth century, often including information back to th
1 CONC e 18th century. They were printed to facilitate the sale of bankrupt est
1 CONC ates and include information about tenants, the lots they rented, the te
1 CONC rms of their tenancy, as well as a map specifying the boundaries. More t
1 CONC han 500,000 tenants are recorded in these documents dealing with more th
1 CONC an 8,000 estates throughout the country.
1 CONT 
1 CONT By the mid 19th Century many of the large Irish estates were in seriou
1 CONC s financial difficulty. Land owners found themselves legally obliged t
1 CONC o pay out annuities and charges on their land, mainly to pay mortgages o
1 CONC r ‘portions’ to family members contracted by marriage settlements and/o
1 CONC r wills of previous generations. All of these payments had to be met, be
1 CONC fore the owner/ occupier could take an income from their estate.
1 CONT 
1 CONT By the time of the Famine, as prices for sale or rental of land plummete
1 CONC d, the monies that had to be paid out from the individual estates remain
1 CONC ed the same, and many Irish estates became insolvent as debts exceeded e
1 CONC arnings. However, the landowners could not sell their estates to dischar
1 CONC ge their debts, because the land was entailed. In 1848 and 1849, two Enc
1 CONC umbered Estates Acts were passed to facilitate sale of these estates. Un
1 CONC der the second act, (12 & 13 Vict., c. 77), an Encumbered Estates Cour
1 CONC t was established, whereby the state took ownership of these propertie
1 CONC s and then sold them on with a parliamentary title, free from the threa
1 CONC t of contested ownership.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Establishment of the Land Courts
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Encumbered Estates Court was established in 1849. In 1852, it was re
1 CONC placed by the Landed Estates Courts, which was itself superseded in 187
1 CONC 7 by the Land Judges Court, part of the Chancery Division of the High Co
1 CONC urt. Although there were some differences in the powers of these courts
1 CONC , their principal function remained the same, to sell off insolvent esta
1 CONC tes.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Land Courts system was the first significant step towards the break-
1 CONC up of the old estates in Ireland. From the genealogist’s perspective, th
1 CONC e Rentals have an added value, because the estate records (rentals, maps
1 CONC , leases) that would have existed prior to these sales, no longer surviv
1 CONC e. This is because once the parliamentary grant to title was secured b
1 CONC y purchase from the Land Courts, there was no need to retain any of th
1 CONC e documentation regarding previous land title.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT What the Rentals are and where can they be found
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Rentals are effectively printed sale-catalogues, which were circulat
1 CONC ed to prospective purchasers in advance of the sale. They were compile
1 CONC d with the intention of attracting purchasers and of providing informati
1 CONC on on the estate in a clear and uniform manner. The Land Courts sold est
1 CONC ates in every county in Ireland, and the Rentals as a whole cover larg
1 CONC e parts of the country. The estates now sold included urban as well as r
1 CONC ural property, and many of the Rentals relate to houses and other buildi
1 CONC ngs in villages, towns and cities. The information is printed and presen
1 CONC ted in a standard manner.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Structure of the Rentals/Sale-catalogues
1 CONT 
1 CONT The title page in a Rental identifies the estate and gives the date an
1 CONC d place of the sale. This is usually followed by brief descriptive parti
1 CONC culars of the estate and its situation, intended to attract prospectiv
1 CONC e buyers. Anyone who has read the property section of a newspaper, wil
1 CONC l know what to expect in this section.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The descriptive particulars are generally followed by observations and c
1 CONC onditions of sale.
1 CONT 
1 CONT To the genealogist the critical information contained in these catalogue
1 CONC s are the Rentals, especially the Lot descriptions. These outline the ow
1 CONC nership and occupation history of the lot, the quantity of land and th
1 CONC e yearly rent that can be charged. Most significantly, they also includ
1 CONC e the list of tenants, the size of the holding and the terms of tenure.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Where a tenant held by lease, rather than on a yearly tenancy, the parti
1 CONC culars will also name all lives contracted for (usually three), and an
1 CONC y of those named still alive at the time of the sale. So the informatio
1 CONC n contained in the Rentals can allow the genealogist to document connect
1 CONC ions between close family members going back one or more generations.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Rentals also usually include a map to situate the estate or lot in r
1 CONC elation to the surrounding countryside, and often also a detailed map o
1 CONC f the lot itself. In the case of urban property, you will find a villag
1 CONC e or town-plan.

1 CONC y are illegible. I interpreted the handwriting to the best of my ability
1 CONC , and many errors were undoubtedly made. When searching the records, rem
1 CONC ember that many times the original transcriber spelled the names phoneti
1 CONC cally, and are not necessarily spelled as you may think. Many of the sur
1 CONC names had multiple variant spellings, so is best to search all variation
1 CONC s. Therefore, you should use this information as a guide only and if yo
1 CONC u think you find an ancestor, you should always refer back to the film i
1 CONC tself.
1 CONT 
1 CONT For the Marriages, “-pt-“ and the names mentioned 
1 CONT after this, are the witnesses to the marriages. In the actual records i
1 CONC t

1 CONT BAPTISMS
1 CONT The Catholic parish of Knock contains the civil parish of Knock.
1 CONT The LDS film number for the Knock (Aghamore) and Knock parish Baptism re
1 CONC cords is 1279206.
1 CONT The first Baptismal transcriptions are for Aghamore, 1864-1883 inclusive
1 CONC .
1 CONT The second set of transcriptions are for Knock, 1869-1905 inclusive.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The “-sp-“ following the parents’ names means sponsors or Godparents.
1 CONT 
1 CONT These records are not complete, and many errors exist due to the very po
1 CONC or quality of the film. Many of the entries were not transcribed as the
1 CONC y are illegible. I interpreted the handwriting to the best of my ability
1 CONC , and many errors were undoubtedly made. When searching the records, rem
1 CONC ember that many times the original transcriber spelled the names phoneti
1 CONC cally, and are not necessarily spelled as you may think. Many of the sur
1 CONC names had multiple variant spellings, so is best to search all variation
1 CONC s. Therefore, you should use this information as a guide only and if yo
1 CONC u think you find an ancestor, you should always refer back to the film i
1 CONC tself.

1 CONT 
1 CONT The actual naturalization volumes vary in size and format. Prior to th
1 CONC e late 1800s each document was usually handwritten on one page. From th
1 CONC e late 1800s and on, printed forms were used. After 1906 many entries we
1 CONC re typewritten.
1 CONT 
1 CONT While there were various types of naturalization records, the Declaratio
1 CONC n of Intent and Naturalization Petition usually had the most complete ge
1 CONC nealogical information.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT The first naturalization act was passed in 1802. Immigrants to the Unite
1 CONC d States were not required to apply for citizenship. Of those who did ap
1 CONC ply, many did not complete the requirements for citizenship.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Naturalization to become a U.S. citizen was a two-part process: the Decl
1 CONC aration of Intent to Naturalize, or First Papers, and the Naturalizatio
1 CONC n Record (including the Naturalization Petition), or Final Papers. The F
1 CONC irst Papers were normally filed five years before the Final Papers becau
1 CONC se of the five-year residency requirement to become a citizen. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT No centralized files existed before 1906. In 1906, federal forms replace
1 CONC d the various formats that had been used by the various courts. Copies w
1 CONC ere sent to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), creatin
1 CONC g a central file for naturalization papers. The INS is now known as th
1 CONC e U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Naturalization records are generally well preserved, but some records ma
1 CONC y have been lost to fire or other disasters.
1 CONT 
1 CONT After 1906 the entries generally include the name of petitioner; address
1 CONC ; name of the court in which naturalization occurred; certificate, petit
1 CONC ion, or other identifying document number; country and date of birth; da
1 CONC te and place of arrival in the United States; date of naturalization; an
1 CONC d name and address of witnesses. Although space was provided for this in
1 CONC formation, it is not always present on every card. Index cards for natur
1 CONC alizations taking place prior to 1906 typically contain only the name o
1 CONC f the petitioner, the name of the court in which naturalization occurred
1 CONC , document number, country of origin, and the date of naturalization.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Naturalization is the process of granting citizenship privileges and res
1 CONC ponsibilities to foreign-born residents. Most counties recorded naturali
1 CONC zation procedures in the court records as legal proof of citizenship. Th
1 CONC e courts handling naturalizations changed several times so the card inde
1 CONC x was created as a way to quickly access specific records.
1 CONT 
1 CONT What Can These Records Tell Me?

1 CONC tain the following information. Not all information is provided on ever

0 @N0529@ NOTE Valuation Office books 1824-1856
1 CONT The printed volumes of the Primary (or Griffith’s) Valuation, the recor
1 CONC d of Ireland’s first comprehensive property tax, have been available onl
1 CONC ine for many years now, and are a crucial part of the genealogical infra
1 CONC structure for the mid-nineteenth century. But the records which underli
1 CONC e and inform the printed valuation have never been digitised until now
1 CONC , and they contain more information about households and landholding tha
1 CONC n can be found in the printed version.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The valuation of Ireland was made for the purpose of levying tax on prop
1 CONC erty. The initial work of capturing information on every piece of proper
1 CONC ty in the country took place between 1830 and the mid-1860s, and the arc
1 CONC hives of this work are held by the National Archives. Since that time, t
1 CONC he valuation has been continuously revised and updated, and the revisio
1 CONC n documents are held by the Valuation Office. In general, archives relat
1 CONC ing to counties now in Northern Ireland are held by the Public Record Of
1 CONC fice of Northern Ireland in Belfast, although some are in the National A
1 CONC rchives. The work of valuation created a large collection of archives, w
1 CONC hich are now useful for researchers seeking information on a wide rang
1 CONC e of subjects, from family history to academic studies. These document
1 CONC s cover the entire country and, while the work was complex and technical
1 CONC , they were made according to a standard method and provide informatio
1 CONC n about families and society at a period when few other sources are exta
1 CONC nt.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The valuation work was carried out by professional valuators, assisted b
1 CONC y other staff, who worked their way through the country, county by count
1 CONC y, beginning in the north. The date of the work in each county varies. T
1 CONC hey recorded the information needed in Field Books, House Books and othe
1 CONC r documents. The work in the field was undertaken first, then the offic
1 CONC e work and, following an appeal process, the valuation was finalised.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Townland Valuation
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Townland Valuation was the first valuation and it took place under A
1 CONC cts passed between 1826 and 1836. The objective was to create a valuatio
1 CONC n of the entire country in counties, baronies, parishes and townlands. I
1 CONC ndividual occupiers were not named unless they held a house that was val
1 CONC ued at more than £5 after 1836, or £3 before that date. Information on t
1 CONC he land was collected, but did not relate to individual farms. Twenty-si
1 CONC x counties were valued in this manner before the system was changed.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Tenement Valuation
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Tenement Valuation was introduced in a piecemeal fashion and, in th
1 CONC e beginning, it overlapped with the continuation of the Townland Valuati
1 CONC on. The first Tenement Act was in 1846, following partial measures intro
1 CONC duced in 1844, and only covered counties not valued by the Townland Valu
1 CONC ation (Cork, Dublin, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford). The Tene
1 CONC ment Valuation was extended to the entire country with the 1852 Act. Und
1 CONC er the Tenement Valuation, every individual tenement or holding was reco
1 CONC rded, including the names of the occupiers, and the documents contain la
1 CONC rge numbers of names of householders. The field work and office work too
1 CONC k place in the same manner as in the Townland Valuation, and the draft v
1 CONC aluation prepared for appeals was published as the Primary Valuation, o
1 CONC r Griffith’s Valuation. Following the appeals, the valuation was finall
1 CONC y settled and recorded in the ‘cancelled books’ now held by the Valuatio
1 CONC n Office.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT There are four distinct kinds of books involved:
1 CONT 
1 CONT Field Books - The Field Books of the Valuation Office are manuscript boo
1 CONC ks that record the information required for the valuation of agricultura
1 CONC l land. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT House Books - The House Books of the Valuation Office are manuscript boo
1 CONC ks in which information on houses and buildings is recorded. The books i
1 CONC nclude houses and buildings situated in rural areas and in cities, town
1 CONC s and villages. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Tenure Books - The Valuation Office Tenure books are a series of manuscr
1 CONC ipt notebooks in which information required for the Tenement Valuation w
1 CONC as compiled. The Tenure Books are also known as Perambulation Books, a
1 CONC s the staff ‘perambulated’ or walked around the boundaries of the teneme
1 CONC nts.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Quarto Books - The Valuation Office Quarto Books are a series of manuscr
1 CONC ipt books relating to the valuation of houses and buildings in towns. Th
1 CONC e Quarto Books are found in all counties except Leitrim and Sligo, and i
1 CONC n some counties only a small number of books survive.
1 CONT 
1 CONT These records contain over 2 million names. They provide a comprehensiv
1 CONC e assessment of the rental value of Irish lands and property from the mi
1 CONC d-1820s to the mid-1850s. The books reveal where and when individuals re
1 CONC nted or owned property and provide rare glimpses of life in pre-famine I
1 CONC reland.

1 CONT All the civil birth records on Findmypast are name-indexed, which make

1 CONT 
1 CONT Country wide civil registration of births, marriages and deaths commence
1 CONC d on 1 July 1837 in England and Wales. Registration took place at loca
1 CONC l civil registrars who in turn reported to the Registrar General at th
1 CONC e General Register Office (GRO) in London. This national index to vita
1 CONC l records is an essential source of genealogical information for famil
1 CONC y historians.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Since the original birth, marriage and death registers are not open to t
1 CONC he public, access to the information on one of these certificates is don
1 CONC e by first searching the national birth, marriage and death indexes, tha
1 CONC t have been created by the GRO for this purpose. The indexes for the thr
1 CONC ee events are divided into volumes by year following which entries are l
1 CONC isted alphabetically. Once an entry in one of the indexes is found, yo
1 CONC u are then able to use that information to order of copy of a death, mar
1 CONC riage or birth certificate from the GRO. Information that can be obtaine
1 CONC d from the birth index includes:
