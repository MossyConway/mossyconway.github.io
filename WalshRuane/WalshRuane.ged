5 CONT By the Receiver's account, passed 1st July 1851, it appears that the por
5 CONC tion of these lands now in the hands of tenants, produces (after conside
5 CONC rable abatements having been made) an annual rent of £542 0s. 10d. exclu
5 CONC sive of the untenanted portion which appears to amount to 486a. 0r. 29p
5 CONC . statute measure as appears by the last column of the summary. And, alt
5 CONC hough, the present valuation of the Estate is considerably under the ren
5 CONC ts payable by the Tenantry, yet thre Receiver, who has been over these l
5 CONC ands for the last seven years, states the rents to be fair and reasonabl
5 CONC e, some of the lettings have been made so lately as November, 1849. Th

5 CONT DESCRIPTIVE PARTICULARS
5 CONT 
5 CONT These lands are for the most part good tillage soil and part bottom, ena
5 CONC ble of great improvement by a small expenditure in draining, and now aff
5 CONC ording good rough pasture, there is also a great quantity of veryapprova
5 CONC ble bog, and a large proportion (estimated at eighty acres) of the demen
5 CONC se is tastefully planted with useful and ornamental  timber, varying fro
5 CONC m twenty to thirty years growth, which tends much to beautify and shelte
5 CONC r the grounds. The house which is well sheltered and surrounded by neatl
5 CONC y planted pleasure grounds, containing shrubs of the chiocest kin, can
5 CONC , by some outlay be made a commodious residence.

3 PAGE John's purchase of lot 8
3 DATA
4 TEXT John (Blackjack) Cleary purchased the property from the land commissio
5 CONC n in 1912.  The measure of land was 52 acres 2 rods and 10 perches, slig
5 CONC htly smaller than his earlier holding.  In the Land Commission consolida
5 CONC tion and sale of properties, John (Blackjack) Cleary arranged for plot m
5 CONC odification to include the nearby buildings.  A note in the Revision doc
5 CONC uments indicates that James/John Clearys holdings were modified to inclu
5 CONC de that which was formerly held by Michael Cleary.  Given the large incr
5 CONC ease in value of Michael’s buildings in 1893, it would imply that John/J
5 CONC ames acquired a larger building in addition to their own. This larger bu
5 CONC ilding may be the one still standing, although renovated, in Cossallagh
5 CONC .  It should be noted that the building information on the 1911 Census a
5 CONC ppears to be a variance with the above conclusion in that James’ buildin
5 CONC g is shown with 5 windows whereas Michael’s has only 3.  The 1911 Censu
5 CONC s showed that James’ building had only 3 windows.  The writer conclude
5 CONC d that the survey by the taxing authorities in the property valuation ar
5 CONC e probably more accurate than the census data, thus concluding that th
5 CONC e current standing building is that of Michael Cleary, not John’s.

5 CONT 
5 CONT No one man in street railway service in this part of the country was mor
5 CONC e widely or more favorably known than Motorman Cleary, and his record fo
5 CONC r courtesy and efficiency in the performance of his daily duties is on
5 CONC e that speaks for itself.
5 CONT 
5 CONT His interest in his work was such that he made a close study of human na
5 CONC ture from his viewpoint of a public servant, so that on Decembr 27 of la

5 CONC w some very interesting side-lights on the changes that have taken plac

5 CONT 
5 CONT In that article Mr. Cleary was quoted as saying that in the days of hos

5 CONC y happy indeed. There were no knockers riding the cars. In truth, patron
5 CONC s and employees were mutual friends, and the patrons always helped the c

5 CONC ioned serveral instances where cars jumped the tracks, and the patrons g

5 CONT 
5 CONT There were no fanatics running wild in the good old days, Mr. Cleary poi
5 CONC nted out, and no robberries or holdups on the street cars as now. And ab

5 CONC d to beat the company out of its fare, were few and far between.
5 CONT 
5 CONT Mr. Cleary's first job in transportation in St. Louis was that of drive
5 CONC r on the old Union Line, of which the late Julius Walsh was president. S
5 CONC tarting with this company in 1885 at the age of 18, Mr. Cleary was oblig
5 CONC ed to serve an apprenticeship of one year in the car barns then locate
5 CONC d on the site of the presetn Kossuth Station at 3635 Kossuth Avenue. H
5 CONC e remained at this station throughout his whole career.
5 CONT 
5 CONT The Union line in the middle 80's extended from Fourth and Locust street
5 CONC s over Fifteenth to St. Louis avenue, and thence to Fairground Park. Mr
5 CONC . Cleary served as a car switcher and relief driver, and one of his duti
5 CONC es was to take the car on its run while the regular driver was at lunch
5 CONC , and returning the car ro the regular man an hour or so later.
5 CONT 
5 CONT The fare, Mr. Cleary said, was 5 cents amd it was never necessary to as

5 CONC d the coin to the box. In those days there were no transfers nor trip sh

5 CONT   It is our sad duty to announce the death of the above-named young gent
5 CONC leman, with sad event took place at the Cork St. Hospital, Dublin, on Tu
5 CONC esday, 13th September, after a very brief illness.  Death is always a dr
5 CONC eaded visitor, but when the victim is a young man of promise and tende
5 CONC r years, it is such as makes the stoutest heart tremble.
5 CONT 
5 CONT Deceased who was just 21 years, was the sixth son of James Cleary and fo
5 CONC r the past two years he represented a Dublin firm in the West and Midlan
5 CONC ds as Commercial Traveler.  Suffice it to say that his tact, energy an
5 CONC d ability won for him an enviable reputation among his compeers.  His un
5 CONC tiring zeal to serve his master brought on a chill on Thursday, 8th Sept
5 CONC ember at his residence (58 Dufferin Ave. S.C.R., Dublin).  During his il
5 CONC lness he was attended by Dr. McGuiness, and later by that eminent physic
5 CONC ian, Dr. Day of Cork St. to which he was removed on Monday, 12th Septemb
5 CONC er, on the latter certifying that pneumonia had supervened.  But death h
5 CONC ad come to claim her prize and poor Willie passed peaceably to his Make
5 CONC r as above stated.
5 CONT 
5 CONT The news of his death caused widespread regret, and crowds of sympathize
5 CONC rs gathered to his home to console his afflicted parents.  On Thursday 1
5 CONC 5th ult., the remains encased in a handsome coffin arrived from Dublin a
5 CONC t Ballyhaunis, where they were met by a huge cortege. Conspicuous amon
5 CONC g the gathering were his school-fellows of a few years ago, who were vis
5 CONC ibly affected, and prayers were uttered aloud for his happy repose.  Th
5 CONC e remains lay overnight in the Parish Church of Logboy.
5 CONT 
5 CONT On Friday, 16th September, Solemn High Mass was celebrated for the etern
5 CONC al repose of his soul in Logboy.  The officiating clergy were: Rev. Fr
5 CONC . O’Reilly, Bekan (Celebrant); Rev. Fr. Tuffy, P.P. Knock (Deacon; Rev
5 CONC . Fr. Lavelle, C.O. Logboy (sub-deacon); Rev.J. O’Malley, P.P., Bekan (M
5 CONC aster of Ceremonies);.  In the Choir were Rev. Fr. Tarpey, Bekan, and Re
5 CONC v. Fr. Glynn, P.P., Mountbellew.
5 CONT 
5 CONT Subsequently, the coffin enveloped in the Tri-color, and surrounded b
5 CONC y a beautiful wreath was borne on the shoulders of his comrades to the f
5 CONC amily burial place in Tulrahan.  The cortege, which was of huge dimensio
5 CONC ns, was representative of Ballyhaunis, Hallinlough, Dunmore, Miltown, Cl
5 CONC aremorris and Mountbellew.  It was a striking tribute to the memory of t
5 CONC he departed one.
5 CONT 
5 CONT The Chief Mourners at the gravesite were: James and Margaret Cleary (Par
5 CONC ents); John, Patrick and Henry (Brothers); Delia and Nellie (Sisters); a
5 CONC nd a host of relatives and others, which it would be impossible to menti
5 CONC on.  His exemplary life and childlike simplicity reached into the heart
5 CONC s of his acquaintances who deeply mourn his loss.  To his bereaved paren
5 CONC ts, sisters and brothers, we offer our sincere sympathy in the loss of s
5 CONC uch a fine specimen of manhood.  Thy Will be done.  The last prayers a

3 DATA
4 TEXT The only Cleary shown in the Tithe Applotment of 1833 for the Lurgan-Cos
5 CONC sallagh area is a Pat Cleary & Co, landholder in Cusalough (Cossallagh)
5 CONC , Parish of Bekani (later listed as being in the Parish of Annagh). Pa
5 CONC t Cleary is listed as occupying land in “Cusalough, East and West”, tota
5 CONC lling 41 acres. This description aligns with the size and location of Lo
5 CONC ts 1 and 2 in Griffith’s Valuation in 1856, occuppied jointly by James C
5 CONC leary and two others. Other than the Pat Cleary noted, there were no oth
5 CONC er Clearys listed in the civil parishes of Bekan and Annagh.
5 CONT 
5 CONT The holding was listed at 41 acres 2 perches and 13 rods of arable botto
5 CONC mland, with comment “bog and road”.  In 1833, the Patrick Cleary b. 180
5 CONC 8 , the purported son of Patrick Sr. would have been only 25 years old a
5 CONC nd thus doubtful as lessee of such a sizable property.
5 CONT 
5 CONT The designation of “& Co.” to both Michael Murphy and Pat Cleary Tithe l
5 CONC istings meant that they were standing (responsible for paying) the poo
5 CONC r law tax for other unlisted parties.  In an 1851 Summary of Tenants i
5 CONC n Cossallagh, the primary holders remain Murphy and Cleary.  The Cleary
5 CONC s listed leases included line items for a Patrick, Patrick, Pat & Martin
5 CONC , Martin and James, all holding year-to-year leases.  John Cleary is no
5 CONC t shown at this time, but he does appear in the later Griffiths Valuatio
5 CONC n circa 1856 in the adjacent townland of Lurgan.

3 DATA
4 TEXT The earliest GV circa 1855 showed a Lot 8 with Sections a and b.  The Lo
5 CONC t 8 total area of 89 acres was shared by Patrick and Martin Cleary, wit
5 CONC h about 2/3 of the land controlled by Patrick.  Both of these owners ha
5 CONC d a house in addition to their land holdings.
5 CONT 
5 CONT In a revision to the Cossallagh land records during the interval 1856-18
5 CONC 60, a Thomas Cleary is shown taking over the lease for lot 8a formerly c
5 CONC ontrolled by Patrick Cleary.  This Patrick Cleary is assumed to Patric
5 CONC k Cleary Sr. b. circa 1780.  The Land Revisions carried a note that Thom
5 CONC as was the son of Patrick Cleary.  This change of hands is probably du
5 CONC e to the death of Patrick Cleary Sr.  Although the Patrick Cleary b. 180
5 CONC 8 is old enough to be Thomas’ father, he was noted in his death record a
5 CONC s being a bachelor, thus not the father of Thomas.  
5 CONT 
5 CONT By 1860, then, Thomas Cleary had control of about 2/3 of the land in a j
5 CONC oint holding of lot #8 with Martin Cleary.

3 TEXT VETERAN MOTORMAN HAD A RECORD OF 33 YEARS SERVICE
4 CONT 
4 CONT Edward Cleary, veteran motorman at the Kossuth Station, in fact an eye w
4 CONC itness of the development of local transportation from horse and mule ca
4 CONC rs to the present modern electric system, concluded thirty-three years o
4 CONC f service here when he died of cancer in St. John's Hospital on April 1
4 CONC 7 last.
4 CONT 
4 CONT No one man in street railway service in this part of the country was mor
4 CONC e widely or more favorably known than Motorman Cleary, and his record fo
4 CONC r courtesy and efficiency in the performance of his daily duties is on
4 CONC e that speaks for itself.
4 CONT 
4 CONT His interest in his work was such that he made a close study of human na
4 CONC ture from his viewpoint of a public servant, so that on Decembr 27 of la
4 CONC st year, ina lengthy article in the Globe Democrat, he was able to thro
4 CONC w some very interesting side-lights on the changes that have taken plac
4 CONC e in the temperamental qualities of street car patrons in the passing ye
4 CONC ars.
4 CONT 
4 CONT In that article Mr. Cleary was quoted as saying that in the days of hos
4 CONC e and mule cars the relations between employees and the public were ver
4 CONC y happy indeed. There were no knockers riding the cars. In truth, patron
4 CONC s and employees were mutual friends, and the patrons always helped the c
4 CONC ar crews in their efforts to get the cars over the road. Mr. Cleary ment
4 CONC ioned serveral instances where cars jumped the tracks, and the patrons g
4 CONC ot off and helped to place them back on the rails to keep the service go
4 CONC ing.
4 CONT 
4 CONT There were no fanatics running wild in the good old days, Mr. Cleary poi
4 CONC nted out, and no robberries or holdups on the street cars as now. And ab
4 CONC ove all, the passengers all were honest and cases where passengers trie
4 CONC d to beat the company out of its fare, were few and far between.
4 CONT 
4 CONT Mr. Cleary's first job in transportation in St. Louis was that of drive
4 CONC r on the old Union Line, of which the late Julius Walsh was president. S
4 CONC tarting with this company in 1885 at the age of 18, Mr. Cleary was oblig
4 CONC ed to serve an apprenticeship of one year in the car barns then locate
4 CONC d on the site of the presetn Kossuth Station at 3635 Kossuth Avenue. H
4 CONC e remained at this station throughout his whole career.
4 CONT 
4 CONT The Union line in the middle 80's extended from Fourth and Locust street
4 CONC s over Fifteenth to St. Louis avenue, and thence to Fairground Park. Mr
4 CONC . Cleary served as a car switcher and relief driver, and one of his duti
4 CONC es was to take the car on its run while the regular driver was at lunch
4 CONC , and returning the car ro the regular man an hour or so later.
4 CONT 
4 CONT The fare, Mr. Cleary said, was 5 cents amd it was never necessary to as
4 CONC k for it. The people on the cars paid it willingly by dropping the far
4 CONC e in a box, and many handed their money to other passengers who relaye
4 CONC d the coin to the box. In those days there were no transfers nor trip sh
4 CONC eets to worry about. Really, Mr. Cleary said, the only wirry in servic
4 CONC e then was in winter seasons when the mules growing tired would lie dow
4 CONC n in the snow to rest, and the car crew was compelled to wait upon thei
4 CONC r dipositions to get up again and go on.
4 CONT 
4 CONT Motorman Cleary was born in Dallyhaunis, near Dublin, Ireland, the son o
4 CONC f James Cleary, a contractor. As a youth he attended the schools in Dall
4 CONC yhaunis, and came to America in 1888 with his brother Thomas. Arriving h
4 CONC ere he located at once in St. Louis. His transportation career from th
4 CONC e time of his location in this city down to date, has been cited above.
4 CONT 
4 CONT Survivors of the Motorman Cleary are his widow, who was a Miss Mary A. C
4 CONC arr when they were married here some years ago, four children, two daugh
4 CONC ters, the Misses Adele and Florence, two sons, Joseph and Edward Clear
4 CONC y Junior: four brothers, John and James Cleary, who live in Ireland, an
4 CONC d Martin and Henry of St. Louis, and three sisters, Mrs. Ellen Donnelly
4 CONC , Mrs. Mary Flanagan, and Mrs. Bridget Glynn.
4 CONT 
4 CONT The funeral of Motorman Cleary occurred on April 20 with services in St
4 CONC . Matthew's Church and interment in Calvary Cemetary under the sponsorsh
4 CONC ip of Sheridan Council of the Knights Columbus.

4 TEXT The Census of 1911 shows Patrick as owner of the Ballymangan family prop
5 CONC erty, probably inherited as the eldest son following the death of his pa
5 CONC rents
5 CONT 
5 CONT The house appears larger than that described in the 1901 Census: 7-9 roo
5 CONC ms, 5 windows in the front and 10 outbuildings.  Patrick is noted as th
5 CONC e only owner in Ballymangan.
5 CONT 
5 CONT In 1915, perhaps because of action of the Land Act which caused owners t
5 CONC o sell their properties to a government agency, which then offered the l
5 CONC and for sale to lessors of the same land, there is some evidence that th
5 CONC e land was broken up and redistributed.  Patrick’s land was reduced an
5 CONC d another section is shown to have been purchased by a John Cleary, perh
5 CONC aps Thomas’ brother.  There is also family lore that Thomas’ sister, Ell
5 CONC en, married and remained in the family house.

1 CONT Descriptive Particulars
1 CONT 
1 CONT These Lands are situate within two-and-a-half miles of Claremorris, a Po
1 CONC st, Fair, and Market Town, fifteen and-a-half miles of Tuam, and twenty-
1 CONC nine miles of Athenry, where there is a Station of the Midland Great Rai
1 CONC lway.
1 CONT The soil consists of a warm, friable loam - well adapted for green crop
1 CONC , tillage, or a sheep-walk. Part is light and shallow; but could be muc
1 CONC h improved by deep tillage, manuring and liming - all of which could eco
1 CONC nomically done, as the lands are free from rocks or stones; amd being wa
1 CONC rm and dry can be labored at any season; and the expensive process of dr
1 CONC aining required on other soils is unnecessary.
1 CONT There is a daily conveyance between Claremorris and Athenry.

1 CONC n (Co, Meath); and the Dublin city and county parishes of Clontarf, Naul
1 CONC , Sandyford, and Santry. Almost all of these appear to have registers ea
1 CONC rlier than 1880 in local custody. In addition, the parishes of St John'

1 CONT 
1 CONT "From the 1820s to the 1840s a complex process of reform attempted to st
1 CONC andardise the basis of local taxation in Ireland. The first steps were t
1 CONC o map and fix administrative boundaries through the Ordnance Survey an
1 CONC d the associated Boundary Commission. The next step was to assess the pr
1 CONC oductive capacity of all property in the country in a thoroughly unifor
1 CONC m way. Richard Griffith, a geologist based in Dublin, became Boundary Co
1 CONC mmissioner in 1825 and Commissioner of Valuation in 1827. The results o
1 CONC f his great survey, the Primary	Valuation of Ireland, were published bet
1 CONC ween 1847 and 1864. The valuation is arranged by county, barony, Poor La
1 CONC w Union, civil parish and townland, and it lists every landholder and ev
1 CONC ery householder in Ireland. Apart from townland address and householder'
1 CONC s name, the particulars given are:
1 CONT 
1 CONT name of the person from whom the property was leased ('immediate lessor'
1 CONC );
1 CONT description of the property;
1 CONT acreage;
1 CONT valuation.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The only directly useful family information supplied is in areas wher
1 CONC e a surname was particularly common. The surveyors often adopted the tra
1 CONC ditional Irish practice of using the father's first name to distinguis
1 CONC h between individuals of the same name, so that 'John Reilly (James)' i
1 CONC s the son of James, while 'John Reilly (Michael)' is the son of Michael
1 CONC . For similar reasons, occupations are also sometimes used to tell 'Joh
1 CONC n Ryan (weaver)' from 'John Ryan (farmer)'. Copies of Griffith's Valuati
1 CONC on are widely available in major libraries and record offices, both on m
1 CONC icrofiche and in their original published form. A free online version i
1 CONC s at www.askaboutireland.ie.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT The valuation was never intended as a census substitute, and if the 185
1 CONC 1 census had survived it would have little genealogical significance. A
1 CONC s things stand, however, it gives the only detailed guide to where in Ir
1 CONC eland people lived in the middle of the nineteenth century and to what p
1 CONC roperty they occupied. In addition, a huge quantity of material was prod
1 CONC uced both before publication and in subsequent revisions, making it poss
1 CONC ible in many cases to identify occupiers before the publication date an
1 CONC d to trace living descendants of those originally listed by Griffith. (S

1 CONT 
1 CONT "The Old Limerick Society was founded in November, 1943, with high hope
1 CONC s and ambitions. The aims of the Society were:
1 CONT 
1 CONT 1. To promote the study of the history and antiquities of Limerick.
1 CONT 2. To acquire and conserve local documents, books, plans, etc.
1 CONT 3. To create and foster an interest in everything pertaining to Old Lime
1 CONC rick, and thereby help to help to cultivate a better civic spirit.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Society also worked to preserve local monuments, buildings, document
1 CONC s, legends, ballads, etc.- which were in danger of being lost - and to r
1 CONC ecord and maintain sites of historic interest.
1 CONT In December 1946 the Society produced its first, and only, journal. Thi
1 CONC s magazine made a valuable contribution to the study of Limerick's histo
1 CONC ry. The journal contained five articles, a book review and an account o
1 CONC f the proceedings of the Society, which included talks during the winte
1 CONC r sessions and summer visits to historic places.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Society continued in existence for a few more years but eventually p
1 CONC etered out in 1953. Its dissolution was a serious loss to the cultural l
1 CONC ife of Limerick. Since that time much good work has been done by the Tho
1 CONC mond Archaeological Society, the local press and inidividuals in the pro
1 CONC motion of he study of local history.

1 CONT What is in This Collection?
1 CONT 
1 CONT The collection consists of marriage indexes from Philadelphia for the ye
1 CONC ars 1885 to 1951. The marriage indexes are arranged by the names of brid
1 CONC es and grooms with the year of the marriage and the license number. Th
1 CONC e surname of the spouse is shown in parentheses. Use the license number
1 CONC s listed in the index to find copies of the marriage license records. Mi
1 CONC crofilm containing marriage license records for years 1885-1915 can be l
1 CONC ocated in the FamilySearch "Affidavit of applicant for marriage licens
1 CONC e (Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania), 1885-1915; index, 1885-1916" coll
1 CONC ection, and viewed at the Family History Library and Family History Cent
1 CONC ers. Marriage license records for years 1916-1951 are available at the C
1 CONC ity Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The city and county of Philadelphia were combined in 1854. In 1860, th
1 CONC e city passed a law requiring the Board of Health to register all marria
1 CONC ges. In 1885, Pennsylvania authorized the Orphans’ Court in each count
1 CONC y to register marriages. By 1885, all marriages were supposed to be lice
1 CONC nsed in Pennsylvania. The index entries are type written and arranged i
1 CONC n columns.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Marriage records validate a spouse’s legal claim to property. Marriage l
1 CONC icenses grant permission for a marriage to be performed and replaced th
1 CONC e previous requirements to post banns or intentions. The index was creat
1 CONC ed to provide public officials with a quick and easy access to any speci
1 CONC fic marriage record.

0 @N0440@ NOTE About Landed Estates Court Rentals 1850-1885
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Landed Estates Court “Rentals” are an important source for Irish fam
1 CONC ily history, as they provide extensive information about land occupatio
1 CONC n in the mid-nineteenth century, often including information back to th
1 CONC e 18th century. They were printed to facilitate the sale of bankrupt est
1 CONC ates and include information about tenants, the lots they rented, the te
1 CONC rms of their tenancy, as well as a map specifying the boundaries. More t
1 CONC han 500,000 tenants are recorded in these documents dealing with more th
1 CONC an 8,000 estates throughout the country.
1 CONT 
1 CONT By the mid 19th Century many of the large Irish estates were in seriou
1 CONC s financial difficulty. Land owners found themselves legally obliged t
1 CONC o pay out annuities and charges on their land, mainly to pay mortgages o
1 CONC r ‘portions’ to family members contracted by marriage settlements and/o
1 CONC r wills of previous generations. All of these payments had to be met, be
1 CONC fore the owner/ occupier could take an income from their estate.
1 CONT 
1 CONT By the time of the Famine, as prices for sale or rental of land plummete
1 CONC d, the monies that had to be paid out from the individual estates remain
1 CONC ed the same, and many Irish estates became insolvent as debts exceeded e
1 CONC arnings. However, the landowners could not sell their estates to dischar
1 CONC ge their debts, because the land was entailed. In 1848 and 1849, two Enc
1 CONC umbered Estates Acts were passed to facilitate sale of these estates. Un
1 CONC der the second act, (12 & 13 Vict., c. 77), an Encumbered Estates Cour
1 CONC t was established, whereby the state took ownership of these propertie
1 CONC s and then sold them on with a parliamentary title, free from the threa
1 CONC t of contested ownership.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Establishment of the Land Courts
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Encumbered Estates Court was established in 1849. In 1852, it was re
1 CONC placed by the Landed Estates Courts, which was itself superseded in 187
1 CONC 7 by the Land Judges Court, part of the Chancery Division of the High Co
1 CONC urt. Although there were some differences in the powers of these courts
1 CONC , their principal function remained the same, to sell off insolvent esta
1 CONC tes.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Land Courts system was the first significant step towards the break-
1 CONC up of the old estates in Ireland. From the genealogist’s perspective, th
1 CONC e Rentals have an added value, because the estate records (rentals, maps
1 CONC , leases) that would have existed prior to these sales, no longer surviv
1 CONC e. This is because once the parliamentary grant to title was secured b
1 CONC y purchase from the Land Courts, there was no need to retain any of th
1 CONC e documentation regarding previous land title.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT What the Rentals are and where can they be found
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Rentals are effectively printed sale-catalogues, which were circulat
1 CONC ed to prospective purchasers in advance of the sale. They were compile
1 CONC d with the intention of attracting purchasers and of providing informati
1 CONC on on the estate in a clear and uniform manner. The Land Courts sold est
1 CONC ates in every county in Ireland, and the Rentals as a whole cover larg
1 CONC e parts of the country. The estates now sold included urban as well as r
1 CONC ural property, and many of the Rentals relate to houses and other buildi
1 CONC ngs in villages, towns and cities. The information is printed and presen
1 CONC ted in a standard manner.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Structure of the Rentals/Sale-catalogues
1 CONT 
1 CONT The title page in a Rental identifies the estate and gives the date an
1 CONC d place of the sale. This is usually followed by brief descriptive parti
1 CONC culars of the estate and its situation, intended to attract prospectiv
1 CONC e buyers. Anyone who has read the property section of a newspaper, wil
1 CONC l know what to expect in this section.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The descriptive particulars are generally followed by observations and c
1 CONC onditions of sale.
1 CONT 
1 CONT To the genealogist the critical information contained in these catalogue
1 CONC s are the Rentals, especially the Lot descriptions. These outline the ow
1 CONC nership and occupation history of the lot, the quantity of land and th
1 CONC e yearly rent that can be charged. Most significantly, they also includ
1 CONC e the list of tenants, the size of the holding and the terms of tenure.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Where a tenant held by lease, rather than on a yearly tenancy, the parti
1 CONC culars will also name all lives contracted for (usually three), and an
1 CONC y of those named still alive at the time of the sale. So the informatio
1 CONC n contained in the Rentals can allow the genealogist to document connect
1 CONC ions between close family members going back one or more generations.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Rentals also usually include a map to situate the estate or lot in r
1 CONC elation to the surrounding countryside, and often also a detailed map o
1 CONC f the lot itself. In the case of urban property, you will find a villag
1 CONC e or town-plan.

1 CONT 
1 CONT The actual naturalization volumes vary in size and format. Prior to th
1 CONC e late 1800s each document was usually handwritten on one page. From th
1 CONC e late 1800s and on, printed forms were used. After 1906 many entries we
1 CONC re typewritten.
1 CONT 
1 CONT While there were various types of naturalization records, the Declaratio
1 CONC n of Intent and Naturalization Petition usually had the most complete ge
1 CONC nealogical information.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT The first naturalization act was passed in 1802. Immigrants to the Unite
1 CONC d States were not required to apply for citizenship. Of those who did ap
1 CONC ply, many did not complete the requirements for citizenship.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Naturalization to become a U.S. citizen was a two-part process: the Decl
1 CONC aration of Intent to Naturalize, or First Papers, and the Naturalizatio
1 CONC n Record (including the Naturalization Petition), or Final Papers. The F
1 CONC irst Papers were normally filed five years before the Final Papers becau
1 CONC se of the five-year residency requirement to become a citizen. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT No centralized files existed before 1906. In 1906, federal forms replace
1 CONC d the various formats that had been used by the various courts. Copies w
1 CONC ere sent to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), creatin
1 CONC g a central file for naturalization papers. The INS is now known as th
1 CONC e U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Naturalization records are generally well preserved, but some records ma
1 CONC y have been lost to fire or other disasters.
1 CONT 
1 CONT After 1906 the entries generally include the name of petitioner; address
1 CONC ; name of the court in which naturalization occurred; certificate, petit
1 CONC ion, or other identifying document number; country and date of birth; da
1 CONC te and place of arrival in the United States; date of naturalization; an
1 CONC d name and address of witnesses. Although space was provided for this in
1 CONC formation, it is not always present on every card. Index cards for natur
1 CONC alizations taking place prior to 1906 typically contain only the name o
1 CONC f the petitioner, the name of the court in which naturalization occurred
1 CONC , document number, country of origin, and the date of naturalization.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Naturalization is the process of granting citizenship privileges and res
1 CONC ponsibilities to foreign-born residents. Most counties recorded naturali
1 CONC zation procedures in the court records as legal proof of citizenship. Th
1 CONC e courts handling naturalizations changed several times so the card inde
1 CONC x was created as a way to quickly access specific records.
1 CONT 
1 CONT What Can These Records Tell Me?
1 CONT Index cards for naturalizations taking place prior to 1906 typically con
1 CONC tain the following information. Not all information is provided on ever

0 @N0529@ NOTE Valuation Office books 1824-1856
1 CONT The printed volumes of the Primary (or Griffith’s) Valuation, the recor
1 CONC d of Ireland’s first comprehensive property tax, have been available onl
1 CONC ine for many years now, and are a crucial part of the genealogical infra
1 CONC structure for the mid-nineteenth century. But the records which underli
1 CONC e and inform the printed valuation have never been digitised until now
1 CONC , and they contain more information about households and landholding tha
1 CONC n can be found in the printed version.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The valuation of Ireland was made for the purpose of levying tax on prop
1 CONC erty. The initial work of capturing information on every piece of proper
1 CONC ty in the country took place between 1830 and the mid-1860s, and the arc
1 CONC hives of this work are held by the National Archives. Since that time, t
1 CONC he valuation has been continuously revised and updated, and the revisio
1 CONC n documents are held by the Valuation Office. In general, archives relat
1 CONC ing to counties now in Northern Ireland are held by the Public Record Of
1 CONC fice of Northern Ireland in Belfast, although some are in the National A
1 CONC rchives. The work of valuation created a large collection of archives, w
1 CONC hich are now useful for researchers seeking information on a wide rang
1 CONC e of subjects, from family history to academic studies. These document
1 CONC s cover the entire country and, while the work was complex and technical
1 CONC , they were made according to a standard method and provide informatio
1 CONC n about families and society at a period when few other sources are exta
1 CONC nt.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The valuation work was carried out by professional valuators, assisted b
1 CONC y other staff, who worked their way through the country, county by count
1 CONC y, beginning in the north. The date of the work in each county varies. T
1 CONC hey recorded the information needed in Field Books, House Books and othe
1 CONC r documents. The work in the field was undertaken first, then the offic
1 CONC e work and, following an appeal process, the valuation was finalised.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Townland Valuation
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Townland Valuation was the first valuation and it took place under A
1 CONC cts passed between 1826 and 1836. The objective was to create a valuatio
1 CONC n of the entire country in counties, baronies, parishes and townlands. I
1 CONC ndividual occupiers were not named unless they held a house that was val
1 CONC ued at more than £5 after 1836, or £3 before that date. Information on t
1 CONC he land was collected, but did not relate to individual farms. Twenty-si
1 CONC x counties were valued in this manner before the system was changed.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Tenement Valuation
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Tenement Valuation was introduced in a piecemeal fashion and, in th
1 CONC e beginning, it overlapped with the continuation of the Townland Valuati
1 CONC on. The first Tenement Act was in 1846, following partial measures intro
1 CONC duced in 1844, and only covered counties not valued by the Townland Valu
1 CONC ation (Cork, Dublin, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford). The Tene
1 CONC ment Valuation was extended to the entire country with the 1852 Act. Und
1 CONC er the Tenement Valuation, every individual tenement or holding was reco
1 CONC rded, including the names of the occupiers, and the documents contain la
1 CONC rge numbers of names of householders. The field work and office work too
1 CONC k place in the same manner as in the Townland Valuation, and the draft v
1 CONC aluation prepared for appeals was published as the Primary Valuation, o
1 CONC r Griffith’s Valuation. Following the appeals, the valuation was finall
1 CONC y settled and recorded in the ‘cancelled books’ now held by the Valuatio
1 CONC n Office.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT There are four distinct kinds of books involved:
1 CONT 
1 CONT Field Books - The Field Books of the Valuation Office are manuscript boo
1 CONC ks that record the information required for the valuation of agricultura
1 CONC l land. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT House Books - The House Books of the Valuation Office are manuscript boo
1 CONC ks in which information on houses and buildings is recorded. The books i
1 CONC nclude houses and buildings situated in rural areas and in cities, town
1 CONC s and villages. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Tenure Books - The Valuation Office Tenure books are a series of manuscr
1 CONC ipt notebooks in which information required for the Tenement Valuation w
1 CONC as compiled. The Tenure Books are also known as Perambulation Books, a
1 CONC s the staff ‘perambulated’ or walked around the boundaries of the teneme
1 CONC nts.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Quarto Books - The Valuation Office Quarto Books are a series of manuscr
1 CONC ipt books relating to the valuation of houses and buildings in towns. Th
1 CONC e Quarto Books are found in all counties except Leitrim and Sligo, and i
1 CONC n some counties only a small number of books survive.
1 CONT 
1 CONT These records contain over 2 million names. They provide a comprehensiv
1 CONC e assessment of the rental value of Irish lands and property from the mi
1 CONC d-1820s to the mid-1850s. The books reveal where and when individuals re
1 CONC nted or owned property and provide rare glimpses of life in pre-famine I
1 CONC reland.

1 CONT Historical Background
1 CONT 
1 CONT Civil registration of all births, marriages, and deaths in Ireland bega
1 CONC n in 1864 (except for non-Catholic marriages, for which registration sta
1 CONC rted in 1845). Registration produced two sets of records: registers fo
1 CONC r births, marriages, and deaths and published indexes to these registers
1 CONC . The repositories for the records split in 1922, with the records for N
1 CONC orthern Ireland being kept by the General Register Office (GRO) in Belfa
1 CONC st, while records for the Republic of Ireland are housed at the GRO in D
1 CONC ublin. But the record set as a whole has survived and provides an invalu
1 CONC able source of vital information for Irish research.
1 CONT 
1 CONT This database contains details extracted from the published indexes of I

1 CONT registration district
1 CONT volume and page number for the original record
1 CONT 
1 CONT For some years, records were submitted quarterly, and births were likewi
1 CONC se divided by quarter, which can help you narrow a search, but otherwise
1 CONC , births are listed only by year. You can use the information in the ind
1 CONC ex entry to obtain a copy of the entry in the original register from th

1 CONC rds of the Irish Petty Sessions. There are more than 22 million record
1 CONC s with details of victims and witnesses as well as those accused of a cr
1 CONC ime. The Petty Sessions were the lowest courts hearing cases about mone
1 CONC y owing, domestic disputes and public order offences.
1 CONT 
1 CONT

1 CONT 
1 CONT The image often gives a great deal of additional information including:
1 CONT 
1 CONT Details of the offence
1 CONT 
1 CONT Details of the verdict and the sentence
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Petty Sessions were usually covered by the press so you may find ou
1 CONC t even more about your ancestor’s story in our newspaper collection.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Petty Sessions handled the bulk of lesser legal cases, both crimina
1 CONC l and civil. They were presided over by Justices of the Peace, who wer
1 CONC e unpaid and often without any formal legal training. The position did n
1 CONC ot have a wage, so the role was usually taken by those with their own in
1 CONC come – in practice usually prominent landowners or gentlemen. Justice wa
1 CONC s pronounced summarily at these courts, in other words, without a jury.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Cases of a more serious nature, which did require a jury, were held at t
1 CONC he Quarter Sessions, which, as the name suggests were held four time
1 CONC s a year. The most serious cases, those like murder or treason that carr
1 CONC ied the death penalty, were presided over by at least one legally traine
1 CONC d judge at assizes held twice a year in circuit. The jury courts use
1 CONC d a system known as a commission of Oyer and Terminer, a Norman French p
1 CONC hrase meaning To See and To Judge. There were two juries, a Grand Jury w
1 CONC ho assessed the strength of the prosecution evidence, and the trial jury
1 CONC , who would hear the case if the Grand Jury had decided the case was str
1 CONC ong enough to go forward to trial.
1 CONT 
1 CONT At the lower levels though, justice was summary and swift. The Petty Ses
1 CONC sions, which sat daily, weekly or monthly, depending on the volume of ca
1 CONC ses, often saw controversial judgements. Every court had a clerk, whos
1 CONC e job it was to record the details of each case in a register. It is tho
1 CONC se registers you are looking at in these records. The clerks also collec
1 CONC ted any fees from those involved in the cases.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Petty Sessions were formally established with legislation in 1827, a
1 CONC lthough they had been in operation for centuries before that. By 1851, a
1 CONC mid growing concerns about the fairness of some of the justices of the p
1 CONC eace, the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act sought to tighten up the rules. J
1 CONC Ps were gradually replaced by trained and paid magistrates as the 19th c
1 CONC entury went on.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Covering both civil and criminal cases, the Petty Sessions’ brief was wi
1 CONC de. Cases ranged from merchants who had not paid duty on their goods, t
1 CONC o workers suing for unpaid wages. Farmers were fined for letting their c
1 CONC attle wander or for allowing their cart to be driven without their nam
1 CONC e painted on the side. Debts were collected and disputes settled. Publi
1 CONC c drunkenness was a common offence, as was assault and general rowdiness
1 CONC . Political feelings were often volatile and there are frequent cases al
1 CONC l over the country of people charged with putting up seditious posters o
1 CONC r leaflets.
1 CONT 
1 CONT There are very few registers which pre-date 1851 and none for Dublin cit
1 CONC y, Dun Laoghaire (Kingstown) and some other districts, either because th
1 CONC ey weren’t covered by the 1851 Act or because the records did not surviv
1 CONC e. However the latest records added include those for one of the main Du
1 CONC blin courts, Kilmainham, for most years between 1833 and 1854 as well a
1 CONC s the year 1887. Findmypast has also added more of the available pre-185
1 CONC 1 records. Further records will be added in due course.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Included in the records are the colour images from Newmarket-on-Fergus i
1 CONC n County Clare. These records a kindly provided by Dr Patrick Waldron. D
1 CONC r Waldron’s first cousin three times removed, Georgina Frost, made histo
1 CONC ry by becoming the first woman to hold a centrally appointed official ro
1 CONC le as clerk of both Newmarket-on-Fergus and Sixmilebridge courts. Georgi
1 CONC na Frost was the third generation of the same family to hold this role a
1 CONC nd won her legal challenge to be able to take up the job, something sh
1 CONC e would normally have been barred from doing, as a woman.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Petty Sessions were replaced by the District Courts in Ireland in 19
1 CONC 24. The system continues in Northern Ireland where they are usually refe
1 CONC rred to as Magistrate’s Courts.

1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT [Evidence: ]
1 CONT The only Cleary shown in the Tithe Applotment of 1833 for the Lurgan-Cos
1 CONC sallagh area is a Pat Cleary & Co, landholder in Cusalough (Cossallagh)
1 CONC , Parish of Bekan  (later listed as being in the Parish of Annagh).  Pa
1 CONC t Cleary is listed as occupying land in “Cusalough, East and West”, tota
1 CONC lling 41 acres. This description aligns with the size and location of Lo
1 CONC ts 1 and 2 in Griffith’s Valuation in 1856, occuppied  jointly by Jame
1 CONC s Cleary and two others. Other than the Pat Cleary noted, there were n
1 CONC o other Clearys listed in the civil parishes of Bekan and Annagh.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The holding was listed at 41 acres 2 perches and 13 rods of arable botto
1 CONC mland, with comment “bog and road”.  In 1833, the Patrick Cleary b. 180
1 CONC 8 , the purported son of Patrick Sr. would have been only 25 years old a
1 CONC nd thus doubtful as lessee of such a sizable property.  The probable own
1 CONC er would have been a Patrick Sr. The several other Cleary parties liste
1 CONC d are all proposed as potential children of Patrick Cleary Sr.  The foll
1 CONC owing text will develop the basis for that logic.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT The designation of “& Co.” to both Michael Murphy and Pat Cleary Tithe l
1 CONC istings meant that they were standing (responsible for paying) the poo
1 CONC r law tax for other unlisted parties.  In an 1851 Summary of Tenants i
1 CONC n Cossallagh, the primary holders remain Murphy and Cleary.  The Cleary
1 CONC s listed leases included line items for a Patrick, Patrick, Pat & Martin
1 CONC , Martin and James, all holding year-to-year leases.  John Cleary is no
1 CONC t shown at this time, but he does appear in the later Griffiths Valuatio
1 CONC n circa 1856 in the adjacent townland of Lurgan. 
1 CONT  
1 CONT 
1 CONT By the time of the Griffiths Valuation publication, the lots had been co
1 CONC mbined and re-numbered as shown in the GV extracts showing holdings by P
1 CONC atrick, Martin and James Cleary.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1856, the approximate time of the Griffith Valuation, Patrick held tw
1 CONC o thirds of 89 acres of land in Cossallagh jointly with Martin Cleary, b
1 CONC elow, as well as a house and out-office of his own.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In a property revision note in 1860-61, Patrick’s name as lessee was rem
1 CONC oved and the name of his son, Thomas, was substituted.  See informatio
1 CONC n on the page of Thomas Cleary 1828 - 1891.  It is assumed that the elde
1 CONC r Patrick died circa 1860.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Further informatin supporting this proposal appears on the page of eac

1 CONC d revisions as the son of Patrick Cleary, assumed to be the Patrick Sr
1 CONC . b. circa 1785 (see introductory text to lettered sections of this repo
1 CONC rt).   In Cossallagh, Thomas had control of about 2/3 of the land in a j
1 CONC oint holding of lot #8 with Martin Cleary.  The buildings held by Thoma
1 CONC s were valued at 10 shillings.
1 CONT They (Thomas and Catherine) resided in Cossallagh until around 1875 whe
1 CONC n they moved to Ballymangan, Hollymount.  The property revision document
1 CONC s for Cossallagh indicate1877 as the date of lease transfer from Thoma
1 CONC s to James Cleary (treated in Section F of this Report), their relations
1 CONC hip unknown, but they are putative brothers.
1 CONT The Irish Law Times of 1874 lists the same of land owned by John Nolan F
1 CONC errall in the townland of Ballymangan.  Three of the lots listed are wit
1 CONC hin the townland and comprise most of the townland area.  The Land Revis
1 CONC ion records indicate that Thomas Cleary purchased one of the lots of abo
1 CONC ut 50 acres.  This would have been the property to which Thomas Cleary a
1 CONC nd his family moved around 1875.  By 1901, the Land Revisions indicate
1 CONC d that Thomas had purchased another of the lots, the largest, of 177 acr
1 CONC es. The actual date of sale if not given, but would have been before Tho
1 CONC mas’ death in 1891. This additional land purchase probably included th
1 CONC e large house described in the 1901 Census, below.
1 CONT Ballymangan is described as being situated within two miles of the post-
1 CONC town of Hollymount and six miles from Claremorris.  The land was describ
1 CONC ed as of superior quality and well circumstanced as to roads.
1 CONT 
1 CONT With the death of Thomas in 1891, the land passed to his son Patrick.  T
1 CONC his was the time when the Land Act was appropriating with compensation t
1 CONC he prior land owners and offering it to the former lessees at reasonabl
1 CONC e payback rates.  The Cleary family, then led by Thomas’ son, Patrick, w
1 CONC ere successful in obtaining the option to purchase the land, except tha
1 CONC t held by Heaney, through to 1910.

1 CONC t of the house and 7 out-buildings. The old house is still standing is c

0 @N0816@ NOTE I never realized that my father MARTIN CLEARY, (born in 1893), wa
1 CONC s from a family of nine children:
1 CONT 
1 CONT      BRIDGET, the eldest, is not listed in the censes for 1901 but thi
1 CONC s may be explained by the fact she had an aunt (her mother’s sister) wh
1 CONC o was a schoolteacher on Inish Boffin (an inhabited island) and, even a
1 CONC t nine years of age, she may have been visiting her and, perhaps, attend
1 CONC ing school there. However, I know nothing more about Bridget. It would b
1 CONC e interesting to know if she is mentioned in the 1911 census. It would a
1 CONC lso be helpful to know whether she was registered as a pupil with her si
1 CONC blings Martin and Thomas and Kate and Michael at Brickens National Schoo
1 CONC l (close to Cossalogh).
1 CONT 
1 CONT      THOMAS (born in 1894) and WILLIAM JOSEPH (born in 1901). My father
1 CONC , Martin, and my uncle Michael, never spoke to us about these two brothe
1 CONC rs of theirs. It was only after my uncle Michael died we realized how ve
1 CONC ry little we knew. We were doubly surprised to learn his family knew n
1 CONC o more than we did and our mother maintained, to the very end, that sh
1 CONC e never thought to ask her husband or her mother-in-law any of these rat
1 CONC her obvious questions. (Indeed, I must say she was very much prone to se
1 CONC crecy herself). My eldest sister, Mary Jo (born in 1937) has a hazy memo
1 CONC ry of a conversation she overheard as a little girl. The conversation ha
1 CONC d to do with a terrible accident which occurred and involved two young b
1 CONC oys. An overladen horse-cart overturned and the two boys were killed. Wh
1 CONC en the speakers realized my sister was listening they clammed up. I am q
1 CONC uite certain William never made the move to Logboy with his parents, so
1 CONC , if he and his brother were killed, he would have been no more than sev
1 CONC en years old and his brother no more than fourteen. I hasten to add, how
1 CONC ever, we have no credible information from any source to support or den
1 CONC y this tragedy.
1 CONT 
1 CONT      KATE (born in 1896). At this stage, I can tell you the move from Co
1 CONC ssalogh to Logboy took place on the second Friday in May 1908. I heard t
1 CONC his myself from Mary Ellen Ruane (nee Godfrey) whose family also moved t
1 CONC here (with her) on the same auspicious day. This date is supported by th
1 CONC e fact that 13 year old Kate registered as a pupil at Logboy National Sc
1 CONC hool on June 9th 1908, her 10 year old brother Michael registered on Jun
1 CONC e 15th and her 8 year old sister Mary registered the following week, Jun
1 CONC e 22nd 1908. Her then 3 year old sister Nellie would register the follow
1 CONC ing year, April 21st 1909. I must admit, I know nothing more about Kate.
1 CONT 
1 CONT      MICHAEL (born 1898). There is a good deal of information on him i
1 CONC n your records. He was highly respected locally and in Dublin.
1 CONT 
1 CONT      PATRICK (born in 1899). Patrick would have been 9 years old in 1908
1 CONC . He did not register as a pupil at Logboy School and there is no indica
1 CONC tion he ever got to Logboy. I notice his sponsors at Baptism were Edwar
1 CONC d and Margaret Glynn whom I do not know and I wonder what their connecti
1 CONC on with the family might have been. I imagine he died in childhood. I ne
1 CONC ver heard of him.
1 CONT 
1 CONT      MARY (born in 1900). Mary attended Logboy National School. It seems
1 CONC , the War of Independence and the Irish Civil War and the political uphe
1 CONC avals of her youth had an adverse impact on her life. She fell in love w
1 CONC ith a boy surnamed Duffy who was on the wrong side of the political fenc
1 CONC e from the Cleary family point of view. They eloped and fled to New Zeal
1 CONC and. Her family disowned and ostracized her. Sometime in the 1980s a you
1 CONC ng man from New Zealand who was working on an oil rig in the North Sea (
1 CONC in Scotland) came across to Logboy to look up his family roots. His surn
1 CONC ame was Duffy and his grandmother was Mary Cleary. She had given birth t
1 CONC o one child, a son, his father. She died in the process. It is probabl
1 CONC e her parents and siblings never knew that.
1 CONT 
1 CONT You mention in the ‘Cleary report’ that the sponsors at Mary’s Baptism w
1 CONC ere Mr and Mrs Roger Murray who, you say, moved to Pollacapul in 1904. T
1 CONC he Murrays were a long-established family in Derryhog and were agents o
1 CONC f the Landlord. Roger and his wife were granted no land in Pollacapul. I
1 CONC f they moved there in 1904, it would have been as temporary gatekeeper
1 CONC s or custodians, I think.
1 CONT 
1 CONT      ELLEN (Nellie) (born in 1905). She lived on with her parents and se
1 CONC ems to have had an attractive personality. The ‘Spanish Flu’, a Europea
1 CONC n wide epidemic broke out at the end of the 1st World War and had more c
1 CONC asualties than the war itself. I always understood it touched the Clear
1 CONC y family and Nellie was the victim. More recently, however, I have com
1 CONC e to believe Nellie died from TB after the epidemic ended. Perhaps Kat
1 CONC e was felled by the flu, --- I don’t know. Indeed, I am thoroughly amaze
1 CONC d at how little I, or any of my siblings, know about my paternal aunts a
1 CONC nd uncles. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT                                          MARTIN CLEARY (1816 – 1892)
1 CONT This Martin Cleary was my great-grandfather. You mention him on page 4 o
1 CONC f the ‘Cleary Report’. His daughter (my grandfather’s sister) married Ja
1 CONC mes Mulkeen from Cloonbook and they had a son called Thomas who became t
1 CONC he father of Jim (James) Mulkeen. They also had a daughter who becam
1 CONC e a Mrs Regan in Ballykilleen, the mother of three sons, Paddy, Jimmy an
1 CONC d Hugh. (Like her own mother, she died at a young age). Mr Regan marrie
1 CONC d again and became the father of two more sons Johnny and Chris. (This C
1 CONC hris Regan received a good education and became General Secretary to th
1 CONC e Irish National Congress of Trade Unions. One weekend, in the mid-1960s
1 CONC , while hiking on the Dublin mountains, fog descended and he became diso
1 CONC riented and lost. Despite Nationwide publicity and exhaustive searches c
1 CONC arried out by army and police and hundreds of volunteers he could not b
1 CONC e found. His body was discovered the following Spring miles away from wh
1 CONC ere his car was parked on the other side of the mountain) The Regans fro
1 CONC m Ballykilleen, the Mulkeens from Cloonbook and the Clearys from Logbo
1 CONC y were cousins and extremely good friends down through the years. Jim, t
1 CONC he last of the Mulkeens, willed the family farm to his wife’s niece Marg
1 CONC aret Owens (nee Rattigan) and her husband Paddy. The Regans lived the ba
1 CONC tchelor life and the family name has died out too. All are buried in Tul
1 CONC rahan cemetery. The farm was willed to my nephew Eric Cleary who lives t
1 CONC here at present. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT                                          MICHAEL CLEARY (1853 -1929).
1 CONT Michael Cleary was my grandfather and your records contain just about ev
1 CONC erything I know about him. He was good looking with his moustache and bl
1 CONC ack bowler hat. He was bi-lingual and could read and write. (The old peo
1 CONC ple would gather periodically to listen to him read the newspaper for th
1 CONC em, I was told). His mother was a Rattigan and he married a Rattigan bu
1 CONC t I presume they were not blood relatives. His wife came from a large fa
1 CONC mily in Musicfield and I have lots of cousins I do not know in the Balli
1 CONC ndine/Milltown area. I know a little about only two of her sisters. On
1 CONC e of her sisters Margaret (my father’s ‘aunt Maggie’) became a school te
1 CONC acher and married a school teacher called Regan from the other end of Ba
1 CONC llykilleen to the Regan family I have already mentioned. He was fond o
1 CONC f alcohol and she thought it would be a good idea to take him to an isla
1 CONC nd far away from his ‘friends’. They taught for many years in Inish Boff
1 CONC in and raised their family there. They are remembered for being strict a
1 CONC nd effective teachers. One of their daughters, Kitty, became a Sister o
1 CONC f Mercy and she died just a few weeks short of her 100th birthday. She s
1 CONC pent her working life caring for orphans in Clifden, County Galway. Anot
1 CONC her of my grandmother’s sisters was Cecilia (‘aunt Celia’). She marrie
1 CONC d a David McWalter in Garrymore and they had a daughter and son. The Dau
1 CONC ghter married John Coyne, a farmer between Ballindine and Milltown and t
1 CONC hey had a large family. So, there are Coynes connected to this branch o
1 CONC f the Cleary family as well!
1 CONT 
1 CONT My grandfather Michael took his family and belongings from Cossalogh t
1 CONC o Logboy in 1908. (Here it should be noted that Pullacappul is an extrem
1 CONC ely ill-defined place-name and is almost never used. It is also a rathe
1 CONC r derogatory name in so far as it means the rear end or the anus of a ho
1 CONC rse. It is a rather small area within Logboy itself and people in Logbo
1 CONC y seem to agree that there were only three or four homesteads with tha
1 CONC t ‘address’). The ‘Congested Districts Board’ acquired the Landlord’s es
1 CONC tate, divided it, erected boundary fences, built a house and barn and al
1 CONC located which of the nine families went where. The Clearys did better th
1 CONC an most in so far as they were allotted a two-story house and a two-stor
1 CONC y barn and, arguably, the most arable land. That part of the landlord
1 CONC ’s estate had been left idle for some years and had become overgrown wit
1 CONC h thistles, gorse, briars and scrub. With none of our modern machinery i
1 CONC n existence on small farms away back then, I imagine, the Clearys and th
1 CONC e other families had years of back-breaking hard labor ahead of them a
1 CONC s they struggled to improve their holdings.

1 CONT                                          MARTIN CLEARY (1893 – 1970)
1 CONT This was my father and, obviously, he was named after his grandfather. H
1 CONC e was 21 years old at the outbreak of the 1st World War. He resisted con
1 CONC scription into the British army; he supported Irish nationalism and inde

1 CONC ty. He was a hard worker, a compulsive talker and a poor listener. He wa
1 CONC s 43 years old when he married in 1936. His wife was Johanna Gibbons fro
1 CONC m Killernan near Kilmaine and she was about 13 years younger than he. Th
1 CONC ey were married in Galway city and the Best Man was Willie Rattigan. (Th
1 CONC is William Rattigan was my Father’s nephew who was born in 1915 and rais
1 CONC ed from infancy by the Clearys in Logboy. He was my Godfather at my Bapt
1 CONC ism in 1944 and he eventually moved to Dublin in the early 1950s. Shortl

1 CONT My Dad and Mam had seven children.
1 CONT 
1 CONT           MICHAEL (born 1939). From the age of seven, Michael suffered f

1 CONT On page 13 of the ‘Cleary report’, the Donnellys from Ballynagron, Cuilm
1 CONC ore Claremorris are mentioned. My father, Martin (1893 – 1970), was ver

0 @N0835@ NOTE About the Oireachtas
1 CONT Ireland is a parliamentary democracy. The National Parliament (Oireachta
1 CONC s) consists of the President and two Houses: Dáil Éireann (House of Repr
1 CONC esentatives) and Seanad Éireann (the Senate) whose functions and power
1 CONC s derive from the Constitution of Ireland enacted by the People on 1st J
1 CONC uly, 1937. The Houses of the Oireachtas are situated at Leinster House
1 CONC , Dublin.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Our A Brief Guide To How Your Parliament Works provides a good overvie
1 CONC w of how Dáil Éireann, Seanad Éireann and the Oireachtas Committees wor
1 CONC k with clear, plain English explanations for many of the terms and langu
1 CONC age used by the Parliament.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Constitution empowers each House to make its own Standing Orders (Ru
1 CONC les) with power to attach penalties for their infringement.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The sole and exclusive power of making laws is vested in the Oireachta
1 CONC s subject to the obligations of Community membership as provided for i
1 CONC n the Constitution.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The primacy of Dáil Éireann in regard to the life of the Parliament is r
1 CONC ecognised in that a general election to Seanad Éireann must take place n
1 CONC ot later than 90 days after the dissolution of the Dáil.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In matters of legislation the Constitution provides that Seanad Éirean
1 CONC n cannot delay indefinitely the passage of legislation. Bills to amend t
1 CONC he Constitution and Money Bills i.e. financial legislation, can only b
1 CONC e initiated in Dáil Éireann.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Seanad Éireann can make recommendations (but not amendments) to Money Bi
1 CONC lls and these must be made within 21 days as against 90 days for non-Mon
1 CONC ey Bills.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In addition to its legislative role, each House may examine and criticis
1 CONC e Government policy and administration. However, Dáil Éireann is the Hou
1 CONC se from which the Government (the Executive) is formed and to which it i
1 CONC s responsible.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Should the Government fail to retain the support of the majority of th
1 CONC e Members of Dáil Éireann, the result can either be the dissolution of t
1 CONC he Dáil and a General Election or the formation of a successor Governmen
1 CONC t.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Role and Powers
1 CONT The Houses have complementary powers in certain areas e.g. the removal f
1 CONC rom office of the President, a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Co
1 CONC urt and the Comptroller and Auditor General, the declaration and termina
1 CONC tion of a state of emergency, the making of law and annulment of Statuto
1 CONC ry Instruments (i.e. delegated legislative power to Ministers).
1 CONT 
1 CONT However, Seanad Éireann does have prior or exclusive powers in two areas
1 CONC :
1 CONT 
1 CONT abbreviating the time within which the President may sign a Bill into la
1 CONC w (called an "earlier signature motion").
1 CONT petitioning the President to decline to sign a Bill until the people hav
1 CONC e decided the matter by referendum (such a petition requires the suppor
1 CONC t of a majority of the Seanad and not less than one third of the Dáil).
1 CONT The President, the Dáil and the Seanad
1 CONT The President may, after consultation with the Council of State, communi
1 CONC cate with the Houses of the Oireachtas by message or address on any matt
1 CONC er of national or public importance.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Committees
1 CONT The Houses have separate constitutional identities. However, in recent y
1 CONC ears the setting up of a well organised system of Joint Committees (i.
1 CONC e Committees of both Houses sitting and voting together) has resulted i
1 CONC n Members of both Houses having additional opportunities to participat
1 CONC e to an even greater extent in specialised parliamentary work.
1 CONT 
1 CONT This includes work in the areas of Foreign Affairs, European Affairs, Ir
1 CONC ish Language, State Enterprise, Women's Rights, Family Matters, Sustaina
1 CONC ble Development and Small Business and Services.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Ceann Comhairle and Cathaoirleach
1 CONT The Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann and the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éire
1 CONC ann are ex officio members of the Council of State which aids and counse
1 CONC ls the President on the exercise and performance by him of certain power
1 CONC s and together with the Chief Justice they constitute the Commission whi
1 CONC ch acts in the event of the absence or temporary or permanent incapacit
1 CONC y of the President.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Television and the Oireachtas (Broadcasting)
1 CONT The proceedings of the Houses and parliamentary committees are televised
1 CONC . The national broadcaster, Radio Telefís Éireann, will broadcast procee
1 CONC dings live on important occasions e.g. Election of the Ceann Comhairle
1 CONC , the Taoiseach and other members of the Government, the Budget Statemen
1 CONC ts, a formal address to the Houses by the President or by visiting Head
1 CONC s of State/Government.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Moreover, RTÉ will in the course of its news and political coverage of p
1 CONC arliamentary business (including Committees) make extensive use of the t
1 CONC elevised proceedings.

1 CONT 
1 CONT Country wide civil registration of births, marriages and deaths commence
1 CONC d on 1 July 1837 in England and Wales. Registration took place at loca
1 CONC l civil registrars who in turn reported to the Registrar General at th
1 CONC e General Register Office (GRO) in London. This national index to vita
1 CONC l records is an essential source of genealogical information for famil
1 CONC y historians.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Since the original birth, marriage and death registers are not open to t
1 CONC he public, access to the information on one of these certificates is don
1 CONC e by first searching the national birth, marriage and death indexes, tha
1 CONC t have been created by the GRO for this purpose. The indexes for the thr
1 CONC ee events are divided into volumes by year following which entries are l
1 CONC isted alphabetically. Once an entry in one of the indexes is found, yo
1 CONC u are then able to use that information to order of copy of a death, mar
1 CONC riage or birth certificate from the GRO. Information that can be obtaine
1 CONC d from the birth index includes:

1 CONT 
1 CONT Friday,13th March 2015 was a red lettered day in the history of the Chur

1 CONC ison thanked God for sixty-two years of Bishop Cleary’s presence in Th

1 CONT 
1 CONT The ceremony which was both solemn and emotional saw many people honou
1 CONC r and pay tribute to Bishop Cleary for his good services in the area o
1 CONC f the pastoral work of the Church, education and inter-Church and inter-
1 CONC Faith relations.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Bishop Michael Joseph Cleary was the second Bishop of the Catholic Churc
1 CONC h of The Gambia. He was ordained a priest in 1953 and on the 29th Octobe
1 CONC r 1954 came to the Gambia as a Missionary. As a young priest sent to th
1 CONC e mission land of the Gambia, his assignment was a teacher of mathematic
1 CONC s in St. Augustine’s High School. He taught in St. Augustine’s for twent
1 CONC y-five years out of which he also served as principal of the school fo
1 CONC r seventeen years. In school he had as students elderly statesmen now li
1 CONC ke Mr. Geoffrey Renner, Tony Carvalho, Tony S. Njie, Pa Adnrew Sylva, Al

1 CONT 
1 CONT In the Catholic Church Bishop Cleary served as Education Secretary fro
1 CONC m 1978-1980. He was ordained as Bishop on the 25th March 1981. He becam
1 CONC e the longest serving Bishop of the Catholic Church in the Gambia as h
1 CONC e served for twenty-five years. During this time, he worked hard to expa
1 CONC nd the outreach ventures of the Catholic Church to the provinces by buil
1 CONC ding up communities and Church structures.  He was re-nowned for havin
1 CONC g a vision of recruiting Gambians into the Catholic priesthood so that t
1 CONC he Church can be called a local Church. Between 1985-2009, he ordained f
1 CONC ourteen priests. His heart has been to see indigenous Gambians take up t
1 CONC he Church from the Missionaries. Today in his retirement he partially ha
1 CONC s realized his dream but that of a Gambian Bishop is yet to come.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Bishop Cleary was a very influential leader who made friends with author
1 CONC ities of State, Muslim leaders and Non Catholic Christian leaders.  He h
1 CONC ad served the Gambia Christian Council for twenty years or more in forgi

1 CONT This collection includes records for the 1911 census, which was taken o
1 CONC n April 2, 1911.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Census schedules consist of large sheets with preprinted rows and column
1 CONC s. The schedules are arranged by county and then divided by civil parish
1 CONC , while some are further subdivided into smaller enumeration districts
1 CONC , each district being an area that could be enumerated in a day. Enumera
1 CONC tors went door to door collecting the data in census books. The census t
1 CONC akers listed only those who spent the night in each household, so indivi
1 CONC duals who were traveling or at school were listed where they spent the n
1 CONC ight. The Registrar General created censuses for various reasons, includ
1 CONC ing population studies, accessing military readiness, compiling lists o
1 CONC f eligible voters, and tracking relief to the poor.

1 CONC ceased. The answers to these questions are a wonderful source to identif

1 CONT About Massachusetts, Passenger and Crew Lists, 1820-1963
1 CONT This database is an index to the passenger lists of ships arriving fro
1 CONC m foreign ports at the port of Boston, Massachusetts from 1820-1963. Th
1 CONC e names found in the index are linked to actual images of the passenge
1 CONC r lists, digitized from National Archives and Records Administration (NA
1 CONC RA) microfilm series, T843 (rolls 1-454) and M277 (rolls 1-115).
1 CONT Information contained in the index includes given name, surname, age, ge
1 CONC nder, ethnicity, nationality or last country of permanent residence, des
1 CONC tination, arrival date, port of arrival, port of departure, ship name, a
1 CONC nd microfilm roll and page number. If a name of a friend or relative who
1 CONC m the individual was going to join with, or a place of nativity was prov
1 CONC ided, that information is included in the index as well. Many of these i
1 CONC tems may be used to search the index in the search template above.
1 CONT 
1 CONT It is important to note that the port of departure listed on these passe
1 CONC nger lists is not always the original port of departure for these indivi
1 CONC duals. A ship could make several voyages throughout the year, making sev
1 CONC eral stops along the way. Oft times the port of departure found on thes
1 CONC e lists is the most recent port the ship was located at prior to arrivin
1 CONC g at the port of Boston. Therefore, if your ancestors emigrated to the U
1 CONC .S. from Germany, they could be found on a passenger list coming from Li
1 CONC verpool, England (if, in this case, the ship left from Bremen, Germany t
1 CONC hen continued on to Liverpool, England before arriving in Boston).
1 CONT 
1 CONT The microcopies of the passenger lists found at NARA are arranged chrono
1 CONC logically by arrival date of vessel. If you do not wish to search this d
1 CONC atabase using the search template, the images may be browsed. See the br
1 CONC owse menu for additional details.

1 CONT About New York, Naturalization Records, 1882-1944
1 CONT Introduction to Naturalization Records:
1 CONT 
1 CONT The act and procedure of becoming a citizen of a country is called natur
1 CONC alization. In the U.S., naturalization is a judicial procedure that flow
1 CONC s from Congressional legislation. However, from the time the first natur
1 CONC alization act was passed in 1790 until 1906, there were no uniform stand
1 CONC ards. As a consequence, before September 1906, various federal, state, c
1 CONC ounty, and local courts generated a wide variety of citizenship record
1 CONC s that are stored in sundry courts, archives, warehouses, libraries, an
1 CONC d private collections. After 1906 the vast majority of naturalizations t
1 CONC ook place in federal courts.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Naturalization laws have changed over the years. These acts are importan
1 CONC t to understand as they would have greatly impacted when your ancestor w
1 CONC as able to become naturalized, as well as the exact process he or she ha
1 CONC d to go through to become a citizen. For example, some naturalization ac
1 CONC ts required residency in the U.S. for a certain number of years, some ex
1 CONC cluded certain ethnicities from being able to become citizens, and other
1 CONC s granted citizenship status in exchange for military service.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Naturalization Process:
1 CONT 
1 CONT The first responsibility for an immigrant wishing to become an officia
1 CONC l U.S. citizen was to complete a Declaration of Intention. These paper
1 CONC s are sometimes called First Papers since they are the first forms to b
1 CONC e completed in the naturalization process. Generally these papers were f
1 CONC illed out fairly soon after an immigrant's arrival in America. Due to so
1 CONC me laws, there were times when certain groups of individuals were exemp
1 CONC t from this step.
1 CONT 
1 CONT After the immigrant had completed these papers and met the residency req
1 CONC uirement (which was usually five years), the individual was able to subm
1 CONC it his Petition for Naturalization. Petitions are also known as Second o
1 CONC r Final Papers because they are the second and final set of papers compl
1 CONC eted in the naturalization process.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Immigrants also took a naturalization oath or oath of allegiance. A cop
1 CONC y of this oath is often filed with the immigrant's first or second paper
1 CONC s. After an immigrant had completed all citizenship requirements he wa
1 CONC s issued a certificate of naturalization. Many of these documents can b
1 CONC e found in the records of the court in which they were created.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Other naturalization records include naturalization certificate stubs an
1 CONC d certificates of arrival. See further below for a description of thes
1 CONC e two documents.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Many immigrants took out their First Papers as soon as they arrived in A
1 CONC merica, in whatever county and state that may have been. Later they woul
1 CONC d file their Second Papers in the location in which they took up residen
1 CONC ce.
1 CONT 
1 CONT What’s Included in this Database:
1 CONT 
1 CONT This database includes naturalization records from New York. The Federa
1 CONC l District Courts took over the naturalization process in 1906, so the n
1 CONC aturalization papers and applications from 1906 onward aren’t held in st
1 CONC ate archives, but at the National Archives.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The naturalization records may contain:
1 CONT 
1 CONT Name of individual
1 CONT Native country
1 CONT Date of naturalization
1 CONT Residence

0 @N1104@ NOTE DEATH OF MR. WILLIE CLEARY, REDHILL, TULRAHAN, BALLYHAUNIS:
1 CONT   It is our sad duty to announce the death of the above-named young gent
1 CONC leman, with sad event took place at the Cork St. Hospital, Dublin, on Tu
1 CONC esday, 13th September, after a very brief illness.  Death is always a dr
1 CONC eaded visitor, but when the victim is a young man of promise and tende
1 CONC r years, it is such as makes the stoutest heart tremble.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Deceased who was just 21 years, was the sixth son of James Cleary and fo
1 CONC r the past two years he represented a Dublin firm in the West and Midlan
1 CONC ds as Commercial Traveler.  Suffice it to say that his tact, energy an
1 CONC d ability won for him an enviable reputation among his compeers.  His un
1 CONC tiring zeal to serve his master brought on a chill on Thursday, 8th Sept
1 CONC ember at his residence (58 Dufferin Ave. S.C.R., Dublin).  During his il
1 CONC lness he was attended by Dr. McGuiness, and later by that eminent physic
1 CONC ian, Dr. Day of Cork St. to which he was removed on Monday, 12th Septemb
1 CONC er, on the latter certifying that pneumonia had supervened.  But death h
1 CONC ad come to claim her prize and poor Willie passed peaceably to his Make
1 CONC r as above stated.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The news of his death caused widespread regret, and crowds of sympathize
1 CONC rs gathered to his home to console his afflicted parents.  On Thursday 1
1 CONC 5th ult., the remains encased in a handsome coffin arrived from Dublin a
1 CONC t Ballyhaunis, where they were met by a huge cortege. Conspicuous amon
1 CONC g the gathering were his school-fellows of a few years ago, who were vis
1 CONC ibly affected, and prayers were uttered aloud for his happy repose.  Th
1 CONC e remains lay overnight in the Parish Church of Logboy.
1 CONT 
1 CONT On Friday, 16th September, Solemn High Mass was celebrated for the etern
1 CONC al repose of his soul in Logboy.  The officiating clergy were: Rev. Fr
1 CONC . O’Reilly, Bekan (Celebrant); Rev. Fr. Tuffy, P.P. Knock (Deacon; Rev
1 CONC . Fr. Lavelle, C.O. Logboy (sub-deacon); Rev.J. O’Malley, P.P., Bekan (M
1 CONC aster of Ceremonies);.  In the Choir were Rev. Fr. Tarpey, Bekan, and Re
1 CONC v. Fr. Glynn, P.P., Mountbellew.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Subsequently, the coffin enveloped in the Tri-color, and surrounded b
1 CONC y a beautiful wreath was borne on the shoulders of his comrades to the f
1 CONC amily burial place in Tulrahan.  The cortege, which was of huge dimensio
1 CONC ns, was representative of Ballyhaunis, Hallinlough, Dunmore, Miltown, Cl
1 CONC aremorris and Mountbellew.  It was a striking tribute to the memory of t
1 CONC he departed one.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Chief Mourners at the gravesite were: James and Margaret Cleary (Par
1 CONC ents); John, Patrick and Henry (Brothers); Delia and Nellie (Sisters); a
1 CONC nd a host of relatives and others, which it would be impossible to menti
1 CONC on.  His exemplary life and childlike simplicity reached into the heart
1 CONC s of his acquaintances who deeply mourn his loss.  To his bereaved paren
1 CONC ts, sisters and brothers, we offer our sincere sympathy in the loss of s
1 CONC uch a fine specimen of manhood.  Thy Will be done.  The last prayers a
1 CONC t the graveside were led by Rev. E. Lavelle, C.C.  May his soul rest i
1 CONC n Peace
0 @N1105@ NOTE A letter from James Cleary, Willie's father, to Austin Cleary, hi
1 CONC s brother, dated Nov 25, 1921 (extract):
1 CONT “Now to poor Willie:  I never go such a shock only getting word on Tuesd
1 CONC ay evening of his illness and went to Dublin on Wednesday morning by th
1 CONC e first train to find him dead before me.  …  He was overboard as gran
1 CONC d a corpse as I have ever seen.  I could not get him down until midday t
1 CONC rain on Thursday. ….I never heard better character of anybody by those t
1 CONC hat knew him well, especially his masters…They paid for a two horse carr
1 CONC iage for me and themselves to escort the remains from the Hospital to th
1 CONC e station in Dublin.  Had he lived a few more months he would have bee
1 CONC n a partner of theirs.  They told me so.  One of them called here a fe
1 CONC w weeks ago.  They liked to see the grave. He had letters of sympathy fr
1 CONC om Claremorris, Belfast, Dublin and other places.  He had a very large f

1 CONT 
1 CONT AMERICAN JESUIT PRIEST and SCRIPTURE SCHOLAR. FR. FRANCIS X. CLEARY, S.J
1 CONC ., was a Roman Catholic Jesuit priest at St. Louis University in St. Lou
1 CONC is, MO, where he was a noted Scripture scholar, homilist, theological ex
1 CONC pert, and Professor of Theology at the Jesuit university, founded in 181
1 CONC 8.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Fr. Cleary, a native of South St. Louis, was the son of Frank X. Cleary
1 CONC , Sr.(1900-1975), a noted St. Louis trial attorney, and Loretto Cooney C
1 CONC leary (1903-1974), a homemaker. (He had one younger unmarried sister, MA
1 CONC RY (1931-1974), who died at the age of 43 and is interred with her mothe
1 CONC r and father on the "James Cooney" family lot at Calvary Cemetery in St
1 CONC . Louis).
1 CONT 
1 CONT Throughout his entire life, Fr. Cleary was known for his extensive commu
1 CONC nications skills and eloquence, as well as his keen Irish sense of humor
1 CONC , which was recalled by many mourners among the large crowd at his memor
1 CONC ial Mass on the St. Louis University campus, where he taught for more th
1 CONC an 30 years. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Ordained a Jesuit priest on June 11, 1963, Father Cleary served on the f
1 CONC aculty of St. Louis University where he was a very popular instructor am
1 CONC ong college students and members of the St. Louis area clergy, religiou
1 CONC s and laity alike. He was also a popular guest celebrant and homilist i
1 CONC n parishes throughout the Archdiocese, where he also provided noteworth
1 CONC y presentations on Scripture and other important Catholic theological to
1 CONC pics that followed the Second Vatican Council of 1961-65. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Fr. Cleary also led many theological discussion groups, directed retreat
1 CONC s, delivered lectures, and did extensive personal counseling during hi
1 CONC s later years throughout the St. Louis area until his health condition
1 CONC s precluded him from doing so. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Frequently consulted by the secular and religious press on many topics a
1 CONC s an expert Catholic resource and panelist, he also wrote a regular colu
1 CONC mn for many years for the local Roman Catholic Archdiocesan newspaper, t
1 CONC he ST. LOUIS REVIEW. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Fr. Cleary was also a historical consultant on the exorcism that becam
1 CONC e the basis for the famed William Peter Blatty movie, "The Exorcist," wh
1 CONC ich took place in the St. Louis area under the direction of two Catholi
1 CONC c priests approved by the Vatican for the process, both Jesuits. 
1 CONT (Fr. Cleary wrote a major article on the deceased Fr. William Bowdern, S
1 CONC .J., one of the principal exorcists).
1 CONT 
1 CONT An alumnus of Our Lady of Sorrows Parish School, St. Louis University (J
1 CONC esuit) High School, St. Louis University, the Pontifical Biblical Instit
1 CONC ute, and the Pontifical Theological Institute in Rome (eventually receiv
1 CONC ing his Ph.D, S.T.L. and S.T.D. degrees), Fr. Cleary remained active unt
1 CONC il health issues mandated his retirement to Jesuit Hall at St. Louis Uni
1 CONC versity, where he died on Wednesday, Dec. 8, 2010 at age 81. During th
1 CONC e last several years of his life, he was largely an invalid although hi
1 CONC s mind and faculties remained sharp. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT On his death, Fr. Cleary willed his body to St. Louis University Medica
1 CONC l School, and a Memorial Mass was held in his honor the evening of Decem
1 CONC ber 14 at the historic St. Francis Xavier College Church on the St. Loui
1 CONC s University campus. Nearly 100 priests, among them fellow Jesuits, dioc
1 CONC esan priests and members of other religious orders who were friends an
1 CONC d peers of Fr. Cleary, concelebrated the Mass. Personal eulogies were pr
1 CONC ovided by fellow clergy, a longtime family member, and a peer from one o
1 CONC f Father Cleary's many discussion groups.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Fr. Cleary will be remembered by many as a popular, erudite, eloquent an
1 CONC d colorful spokesman for the Catholicism that reflected the times follow
1 CONC ing the Second Vatican Council--roughly the late 1960's through the 1980
1 CONC 's. His was a unique niche in the Jesuit order as well as the Archdioces
1 CONC e that will be difficult to fill, and fondly remembered by many in the S
1 CONC t. Louis Catholic community.

0 @N1177@ NOTE VETERAN MOTORMAN HAD A RECORD OF 33 YEARS SERVICE
1 CONT 
1 CONT Edward Cleary, veteran motorman at the Kossuth Station, in fact an eye w
1 CONC itness of the development of local transportation from horse and mule ca
1 CONC rs to the present modern electric system, concluded thirty-three years o
1 CONC f service here when he died of cancer in St. John's Hospital on April 1
1 CONC 7 last.
1 CONT 
1 CONT No one man in street railway service in this part of the country was mor
1 CONC e widely or more favorably known than Motorman Cleary, and his record fo
1 CONC r courtesy and efficiency in the performance of his daily duties is on
1 CONC e that speaks for itself.
1 CONT 
1 CONT His interest in his work was such that he made a close study of human na
1 CONC ture from his viewpoint of a public servant, so that on Decembr 27 of la
1 CONC st year, ina lengthy article in the Globe Democrat, he was able to thro
1 CONC w some very interesting side-lights on the changes that have taken plac
1 CONC e in the temperamental qualities of street car patrons in the passing ye
1 CONC ars.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In that article Mr. Cleary was quoted as saying that in the days of hos
1 CONC e and mule cars the relations between employees and the public were ver
1 CONC y happy indeed. There were no knockers riding the cars. In truth, patron
1 CONC s and employees were mutual friends, and the patrons always helped the c
1 CONC ar crews in their efforts to get the cars over the road. Mr. Cleary ment
1 CONC ioned serveral instances where cars jumped the tracks, and the patrons g
1 CONC ot off and helped to place them back on the rails to keep the service go
1 CONC ing.
1 CONT 
1 CONT There were no fanatics running wild in the good old days, Mr. Cleary poi
1 CONC nted out, and no robberries or holdups on the street cars as now. And ab
1 CONC ove all, the passengers all were honest and cases where passengers trie
1 CONC d to beat the company out of its fare, were few and far between.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Mr. Cleary's first job in transportation in St. Louis was that of drive
1 CONC r on the old Union Line, of which the late Julius Walsh was president. S
1 CONC tarting with this company in 1885 at the age of 18, Mr. Cleary was oblig
1 CONC ed to serve an apprenticeship of one year in the car barns then locate
1 CONC d on the site of the presetn Kossuth Station at 3635 Kossuth Avenue. H
1 CONC e remained at this station throughout his whole career.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Union line in the middle 80's extended from Fourth and Locust street
1 CONC s over Fifteenth to St. Louis avenue, and thence to Fairground Park. Mr
1 CONC . Cleary served as a car switcher and relief driver, and one of his duti
1 CONC es was to take the car on its run while the regular driver was at lunch
1 CONC , and returning the car ro the regular man an hour or so later.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The fare, Mr. Cleary said, was 5 cents amd it was never necessary to as
1 CONC k for it. The people on the cars paid it willingly by dropping the far
1 CONC e in a box, and many handed their money to other passengers who relaye
1 CONC d the coin to the box. In those days there were no transfers nor trip sh
1 CONC eets to worry about. Really, Mr. Cleary said, the only wirry in servic
1 CONC e then was in winter seasons when the mules growing tired would lie dow
1 CONC n in the snow to rest, and the car crew was compelled to wait upon thei
1 CONC r dipositions to get up again and go on.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Motorman Cleary was born in Dallyhaunis, near Dublin, Ireland, the son o
1 CONC f James Cleary, a contractor. As a youth he attended the schools in Dall
1 CONC yhaunis, and came to America in 1888 with his brother Thomas. Arriving h
1 CONC ere he located at once in St. Louis. His transportation career from th
1 CONC e time of his location in this city down to date, has been cited above.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Survivors of the Motorman Cleary are his widow, who was a Miss Mary A. C
1 CONC arr when they were married here some years ago, four children, two daugh
1 CONC ters, the Misses Adele and Florence, two sons, Joseph and Edward Clear
1 CONC y Junior: four brothers, John and James Cleary, who live in Ireland, an
1 CONC d Martin and Henry of St. Louis, and three sisters, Mrs. Ellen Donnelly
1 CONC , Mrs. Mary Flanagan, and Mrs. Bridget Glynn.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The funeral of Motorman Cleary occurred on April 20 with services in St
1 CONC . Matthew's Church and interment in Calvary Cemetary under the sponsorsh
1 CONC ip of Sheridan Council of the Knights Columbus.

0 @N1228@ NOTE The only Cleary shown in the Tithe Applotment of 1833 for the Lurga
1 CONC n-Cossallagh area is a Pat Cleary & Co, landholder in Cusalough (Cossall
1 CONC agh), Parish of Bekani (later listed as being in the Parish of Annagh)
1 CONC . Pat Cleary is listed as occupying land in “Cusalough, East and West
1 CONC ”, totalling 41 acres. This description aligns with the size and locatio
1 CONC n of Lots 1 and 2 in Griffith’s Valuation in 1856, occuppied jointly b
1 CONC y James Cleary and two others. Other than the Pat Cleary noted, there we
1 CONC re no other Clearys listed in the civil parishes of Bekan and Annagh.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The holding was listed at 41 acres 2 perches and 13 rods of arable botto
1 CONC mland, with comment “bog and road”.  In 1833, the Patrick Cleary b. 180
1 CONC 8 , the purported son of Patrick Sr. would have been only 25 years old a
1 CONC nd thus doubtful as lessee of such a sizable property.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The designation of “& Co.” to both Michael Murphy and Pat Cleary Tithe l
1 CONC istings meant that they were standing (responsible for paying) the poo
1 CONC r law tax for other unlisted parties.  In an 1851 Summary of Tenants i
1 CONC n Cossallagh, the primary holders remain Murphy and Cleary.  The Cleary
1 CONC s listed leases included line items for a Patrick, Patrick, Pat & Martin
1 CONC , Martin and James, all holding year-to-year leases.
0 @N1229@ NOTE There were a number of Cleary landholders in Cossallagh and Lurga
1 CONC n in the 1800s. The fact they lived in the same area, and that some of t
1 CONC hem shared lands and traded lands with each other indicates that those l
1 CONC andholders may have been related, but the property records for the mos
1 CONC t part do not say what relationship, if any, existed between these landh
1 CONC olders.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Evidence of the following relationships between the landholders has bee
1 CONC n found:
1 CONT 
1 CONT James and Martin, brothers – A funeral report of James’ son James (b1862
1 CONC ) named Martin Cleary’s grandson Michael as a cousin of James (b1862). S
1 CONC pecifically they were first-cousins-once-removed.
1 CONT 
1 CONT James and Patrick (b1808), brothers – Patrick’s death registration infor
1 CONC mant was his brother James Cleary of Cossallagh.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Patrick (b1780) and Thomas, father and son – Thomas Cleary was noted i
1 CONC n a comment in the 1860-61 Cossallagh land revisions as the son of Patri
1 CONC ck Cleary.
1 CONT 
1 CONT This tree speculates that Patrick (b1780) was also the father of Patric
1 CONC k (b ~1808), Martin (b ~1812) and James (b ~1821), but both Patrick (b17
1 CONC 80) and Thomas are marked [Speculative] because there is no direct evide
1 CONC nce of their connection to this tree.
0 @N1230@ NOTE Catherine Delaney was reported by the grandson of Thomas Cleary a
1 CONC s the daughter of Thaddy Delaney and Bridget Godfrey, but there is no do
1 CONC cumented evidence available.
0 @N1231@ NOTE In a revision to the Cossallagh land records during the interval 18
1 CONC 56-1860, a Thomas Cleary is shown taking over the lease for lot 8a forme
1 CONC rly controlled by Patrick Cleary.  This Patrick Cleary is assumed to Pat
1 CONC rick Cleary Sr. b. circa 1780.  The Land Revisions carried a note that T
1 CONC homas was the son of Patrick Cleary.  This change of hands is probably d
1 CONC ue to the death of Patrick Cleary Sr. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT By 1860, then, Thomas Cleary had control of about 2/3 of the land in a j
1 CONC oint holding of lot #8 with Martin Cleary.  The buildings held by Thoma
1 CONC s were valued at 10 shillings.
0 @N1232@ NOTE Thomas and Catherine resided in Cossallagh until around 1875 when t
1 CONC hey moved to Ballymangan, Hollymount.  The property revision documents f

1 CONT The Irish Law Times of 1874 lists the same of land owned by John Nolan F
1 CONC errall in the townland of Ballymangan.  Three of the lots listed are wit
1 CONC hin the townland and comprise most of the townland area.  The Land Revis
1 CONC ion records indicate that Thomas Cleary purchased one of the lots of abo
1 CONC ut 50 acres.  This would have been the property to which Thomas Cleary a
1 CONC nd his family moved around 1875.  By 1901, the Land Revisions indicate
1 CONC d that Thomas had purchased another of the lots, the largest, of 177 acr
1 CONC es. The actual date of sale if not given, but would have been before Tho
1 CONC mas’ death in 1891. This additional land purchase probably included th
1 CONC e large house described in the 1901 Census.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Ballymangan is described as being situated within two miles of the post-
1 CONC town of Hollymount and six miles from Claremorris.  The land was describ
1 CONC ed as of superior quality and well circumstanced as to roads.
0 @N1233@ NOTE The Buildings summary of the 1901 census indicates there were onl
1 CONC y two families living in Ballymangan, but that Catherine and her famil
1 CONC y were occupying the only large house in the township.   She owned one l
1 CONC ot and half of another, the total comprising about 230 acres.  The othe
1 CONC r half of a lot was owned by John Heany (later by Bridget, his widow) an
1 CONC d held about 52 acres.   Judged by the building details, Catherine’s hou
1 CONC se was large:  a stone dwelling with slate roof, 5 or 6 rooms, 6 window
1 CONC s in front of the house and 7 out-buildings. The old house is still stan
1 CONC ding is currently undergoing renovation.  The census also shows that Cat
1 CONC herine Cleary was the owner of the land, not a lessor.
1 CONT 
0 @N1234@ NOTE With the death of Thomas in 1891, the land passed to his son Patric
1 CONC k.  This was the time when the Land Act was appropriating with compensat
1 CONC ion the prior land owners and offering it to the former lessees at reaso
1 CONC nable payback rates.  The Cleary family, then led by Thomas’ son, Patric
1 CONC k, were successful in obtaining the option to purchase the land, excep
1 CONC t that held by Heaney, through to 1910.

1 CONC e Lurgan GV Revision remains John Cleary.  John Cleary died in 1890 bu
1 CONC t the lot remained in the name of a John Cleary, probably his son, Joh
1 CONC n Cleary Jr. b.1869.  John’s Jr.’s death date and its potential interact
1 CONC ion with the change in Lot 1a ownership is not known.  The first revisio
1 CONC n to this lot in the GV land records occurred in 1906-8 at which time i
1 CONC t was changed to Michael Cleary, the son of Martin of Cossallagh and Joh
1 CONC n Cleary’s purported nephew.  At this same revision the designation “hou

1 CONC . 
0 @N1306@ NOTE Lot 1a highlighted in yellow
0 @N1307@ NOTE In 1911, consistent with the timing of Michael Cleary’s move to Lug

1 CONC ackjack) Cleary of Cossallagh; the property description remained the sam
1 CONC e but no house was listed.  Later, John (Blackjack) purchased Lot 1a fro
1 CONC m the Land Commission.  In the GV revisions the lot remained in the nam
1 CONC e of John Cleary through 1934 at which time the GV revision method termi
1 CONC nated.  John (Blackjack) Cleary had died in 1929, but the land passed ov
1 CONC er time to his son John (Jackie) Cleary, thus the name on the Land Revis
1 CONC ions, John Cleary, remained the same.  
0 @N1308@ NOTE In 1877, James took over the land of Thomas Cleary b.1828 in Lot 8
1 CONC , .  At this time, then, Lot 8 is jointly held between Thomas Cleary an
1 CONC d Martin Cleary.  Around 1912-1914 James Cleary remained the holder of h
1 CONC is property in lot #8 of Cossallagh, but the land had been rearranged th
1 CONC rough government action.  The lot number was changed and his land rearra
1 CONC nged so that it also include the large house which formerly belonged t
1 CONC o his nephew, Michael Cleary, the son of the land’s 1856 owner, Martin C
1 CONC leary.  James remained there until his death.
1 CONT 
1 CONT James switched property with his purported siblings over the years, bu
1 CONC t he remained throughout his life in Cossallagh.  He was the last Clear
1 CONC y property owner there at the time of his death.
1 CONT 
0 @N1309@ NOTE The earliest GV circa 1855 showed a Lot 8 with Sections a and b.  T
1 CONC he Lot 8 total area of 89 acres was shared by Patrick and Martin Cleary
1 CONC , with about 2/3 of the land controlled by Patrick.  Both of these owner
1 CONC s had a house in addition to their land holdings.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In a revision to the Cossallagh land records during the interval 1856-18
1 CONC 60, a Thomas Cleary is shown taking over the lease for lot 8a formerly c
1 CONC ontrolled by Patrick Cleary.  This Patrick Cleary is assumed to Patric
1 CONC k Cleary Sr. b. circa 1780.  The Land Revisions carried a note that Thom
1 CONC as was the son of Patrick Cleary.  This change of hands is probably du
1 CONC e to the death of Patrick Cleary Sr.  Although the Patrick Cleary b. 180
1 CONC 8 is old enough to be Thomas’ father, he was noted in his death record a
1 CONC s being a bachelor, thus not the father of Thomas.  
1 CONT 
1 CONT By 1860, then, Thomas Cleary had control of about 2/3 of the land in a j
1 CONC oint holding of lot #8 with Martin Cleary.
0 @N1310@ NOTE The only Cleary shown in the Tithe Applotment of 1833 for the Lurga
1 CONC n-Cossallagh area is a Pat Cleary & Co, landholder in Cusalough (Cossall
1 CONC agh), Parish of Bekani (later listed as being in the Parish of Annagh)
1 CONC . Pat Cleary is listed as occupying land in “Cusalough, East and West
1 CONC ”, totalling 41 acres. This description aligns with the size and locatio
1 CONC n of Lots 1 and 2 in Griffith’s Valuation in 1856, occuppied jointly b
1 CONC y James Cleary and two others. Other than the Pat Cleary noted, there we
1 CONC re no other Clearys listed in the civil parishes of Bekan and Annagh.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The holding was listed at 41 acres 2 perches and 13 rods of arable botto
1 CONC mland, with comment “bog and road”.  In 1833, the Patrick Cleary b. 180
1 CONC 8 , the purported son of Patrick Sr. would have been only 25 years old a
1 CONC nd thus doubtful as lessee of such a sizable property.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The designation of “& Co.” to both Michael Murphy and Pat Cleary Tithe l
1 CONC istings meant that they were standing (responsible for paying) the poo
1 CONC r law tax for other unlisted parties.  In an 1851 Summary of Tenants i
1 CONC n Cossallagh, the primary holders remain Murphy and Cleary.  The Cleary
1 CONC s listed leases included line items for a Patrick, Patrick, Pat & Martin
1 CONC , Martin and James, all holding year-to-year leases.  John Cleary is no
1 CONC t shown at this time, but he does appear in the later Griffiths Valuatio
1 CONC n circa 1856 in the adjacent townland of Lurgan.
0 @N1311@ NOTE In the early revisions of the Griffith Valuation of 1856, Martin Cl
1 CONC eary, the father of Michael held Lot #8 (a joint holding with Patrick Cl
1 CONC eary) of Cossallagh.  Martin Cleary died in 1892.  The property revision
1 CONC s of 1893 indicate that Martin’s land passed to his first son, Michael
1 CONC .  Michael and his family remained in Cossallagh until they moved to Lug
1 CONC boy Demense by 1911, at which time the land was distributed to unrelate
1 CONC d parties.
0 @N1312@ NOTE The land revision dated 1898 showed that Michael had greatly increa
1 CONC sed the value of their buildings from 5 shillings to 1 Pound 5 shillings
1 CONC .  In an update to the Land Valuations from approx. 1912 it was clear th
1 CONC at James Cleary, who had previously shared lot #8 with Michael, had take
1 CONC n advantage of the shuffling of land associated with the Irish land owne
1 CONC rship revisions to incorporate into his ownership the fine building whic
1 CONC h Michael had erected.
0 @N1313@ NOTE The Property Revisions show that circa 1875 James Cleary transferre
1 CONC d his lease in Lots 1 and 2 to Martin Cleary.  The 1893 GV Revision show
1 CONC s that the Martin Cleary (the Martin b. 1816, d. 1892) lease passes to M
1 CONC ichael Cleary b. 1853, his son.  This change corresponded with Martin
1 CONC ’s death in 1892.  The description of Sections a, b and, c of Lot
1 CONC s 1 & 2 remained the same as the original GV. 
0 @N1314@ NOTE Revisions show that circa 1875 James Cleary transferred his lease i
1 CONC n Lots 1 and 2 to Martin Cleary.  At this same time, James moves take ov
1 CONC er the portion of Lot #8 lease originally controlled by Patrick Cleary S
1 CONC r. who had passed control of his lease to his son, Thomas Cleary aroun
1 CONC d 1856-60.  Thomas Cleary, in turn, moved to Townland of Ballymangan.

1 CONT 
1 CONT After 1904 and the imposition of the Land Act, the lots and sections wer
1 CONC e reformulated and offered for sale to the leaseholders.  By the 1912 Re
1 CONC vision, Michael Cleary b. 1853 was shown lined through and was no longe
1 CONC r a landholder in Cossallagh. The Cleary line had no further associatio
1 CONC n with these lots.  The 1911 Census indicates that a former owner, Micha
1 CONC el Cleary, had moved his family to nearby Lugboy Denense.
0 @N1316@ NOTE John (Blackjack) Cleary purchased the property from the land commis
1 CONC sion in 1912.  The measure of land was 52 acres 2 rods and 10 perches, s
1 CONC lightly smaller than his earlier holding.  In the Land Commission consol
1 CONC idation and sale of properties, John (Blackjack) Cleary arranged for plo
1 CONC t modification to include the nearby buildings.  A note in the Revisio
1 CONC n documents indicates that James/John Clearys holdings were modified t
1 CONC o include that which was formerly held by Michael Cleary.  Given the lar
1 CONC ge increase in value of Michael’s buildings in 1893, it would imply tha
1 CONC t John/James acquired a larger building in addition to their own. This l
1 CONC arger building may be the one still standing, although renovated, in Cos
1 CONC sallagh.  It should be noted that the building information on the 1911 C
1 CONC ensus appears to be a variance with the above conclusion in that James
1 CONC ’ building is shown with 5 windows whereas Michael’s has only 3.  The 19
1 CONC 11 Census showed that James’ building had only 3 windows.  The writer co
1 CONC ncluded that the survey by the taxing authorities in the property valuat
1 CONC ion are probably more accurate than the census data, thus concluding tha
1 CONC t the current standing building is that of Michael Cleary, not John’s.
