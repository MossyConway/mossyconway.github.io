Jim received a copy of a report on Cleary families in Cossallagh and Lurgan, and their descendants, created by the South Mayo Family Research Centre. Over the course of several years Jim expanded the report by adding information from a variety of sources. TOm Sullivan brought the report to my attention.  The latest revision of the report can be found on Tom's public Ancestry tree "Cleary's of Redhill." The information in the report has allowed me to add a huge number of people to this tree.</content><published>2018-05-06T19:00:00+01:00</published></entry><entry><id>tag:mossyconway.github.io/WalshRuane/1</id><title>Move Along Please, Nothing To See Here (Yet!)</title><updated>2018-01-30T18:40:00+00:00</updated><content>The web site has only just been published, so no updates yet, give it some time.</content><published>2018-01-30T18:40:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
