            <strong>DEATH OF MR. WILLIE CLEARY, REDHILL, TULRAHAN, BALLYHAUNIS</strong>
            :
            <br/>
            It is our sad duty to announce the death of the above-named young gentleman, with sad event took place at the Cork St. Hospital, Dublin, on Tuesday, 13th September, after a very brief illness.  Death is always a dreaded visitor, but when the victim is a young man of promise and tender years, it is such as makes the stoutest heart tremble.
           </p>
           <p>
            Deceased who was just 21 years, was the sixth son of James Cleary and for the past two years he represented a Dublin firm in the West and Midlands as Commercial Traveler.  Suffice it to say that his tact, energy and ability won for him an enviable reputation among his compeers.  His untiring zeal to serve his master brought on a chill on Thursday, 8th September at his residence (58 Dufferin Ave. S.C.R., Dublin).  During his illness he was attended by Dr. McGuiness, and later by that eminent physician, Dr. Day of Cork St. to which he was removed on Monday, 12th September, on the latter certifying that pneumonia had supervened.  But death had come to claim her prize and poor Willie passed peaceably to his Maker as above stated.
           </p>
           <p>
            The news of his death caused widespread regret, and crowds of sympathizers gathered to his home to console his afflicted parents.  On Thursday 15th ult., the remains encased in a handsome coffin arrived from Dublin at Ballyhaunis, where they were met by a huge cortege. Conspicuous among the gathering were his school-fellows of a few years ago, who were visibly affected, and prayers were uttered aloud for his happy repose.  The remains lay overnight in the Parish Church of Logboy.
           </p>
           <p>
            On Friday, 16th September, Solemn High Mass was celebrated for the eternal repose of his soul in Logboy.  The officiating clergy were: Rev. Fr. O’Reilly, Bekan (Celebrant); Rev. Fr. Tuffy, P.P. Knock (Deacon; Rev. Fr. Lavelle, C.O. Logboy (sub-deacon); Rev.J. O’Malley, P.P., Bekan (Master of Ceremonies);.  In the Choir were Rev. Fr. Tarpey, Bekan, and Rev. Fr. Glynn, P.P., Mountbellew.
           </p>
           <p>
            Subsequently, the coffin enveloped in the Tri-color, and surrounded by a beautiful wreath was borne on the shoulders of his comrades to the family burial place in Tulrahan.  The cortege, which was of huge dimensions, was representative of Ballyhaunis, Hallinlough, Dunmore, Miltown, Claremorris and Mountbellew.  It was a striking tribute to the memory of the departed one.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Chief Mourners at the gravesite were: James and Margaret Cleary (Parents); John, Patrick and Henry (Brothers); Delia and Nellie (Sisters); and a host of relatives and others, which it would be impossible to mention.  His exemplary life and childlike simplicity reached into the hearts of his acquaintances who deeply mourn his loss.  To his bereaved parents, sisters and brothers, we offer our sincere sympathy in the loss of such a fine specimen of manhood.  Thy Will be done.  The last prayers at the graveside were led by Rev. E. Lavelle, C.C.  May his soul rest in Peace
