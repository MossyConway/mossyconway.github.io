           Michael Brendan Cleary (O’Cleirigh)
Baptised 4 July 1897 (sponsors: Thomas Griffin and Maggie Ratigan).

From his teenage years he involved himself in the struggle for Irish independence. He joined the Gaelic League and became a fluent Irish speaker and later a teacher of the language. He became active in the Irish Volunteers in the years 1918 and 1919 and became Officer Commanding the South Mayo Brigade of the Irish Republican Army during the War of Independence when he was forced to go 'on the run'. With the majority of commanders in the Western Divisions he opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty. 

After the war he was employed as an Irish language teacher in Ballina technical school where the headmaster was Tom Derrig of Westport, a colleague from the War. Both resigned their posts in 1925 because of their objection to the Oath of Allegiance to the Crown and taught in the Irish language colleges at Spiddal and Tourmakeady. Tom Derrig subsequently became Minister for Education when Fianna Fail came to power in the 1930s and eventually became Minister for Lands in the 1950s. 

Michael O'Cleary, or Micheál O Céirigh as he preferred to be called, was a founding member of the Fianna Fail party. O Céirigh stood as a candidate in North Mayo in the general election of June 1927 but was unsuccessful. He was elected in the election of September 1927 and re­elected in 1932 and 1933. In 1937 he transferred to the South Mayo constituency and headed the poll in that year's election and again in 1938, 1943 and 1944. 

Michael was appointed County registrar for Dublin in 1944 and resigned his Dáil seat a year later. From 1934 to 1939 he resided in Dublin at which time he moved to Old Head, near Westport where he lived for two years. In 1942 he moved to Ballyhaunis and returned to Dublin again in 1945.

He qualified as a solicitor in 1934 and joined the practice of Austin Crean, who was then the County Sheriff. The principal of the practice nowadays is John O'Dwyer who trades under the style of Crean, O Ceirigh and O'Dwyer.  He retired as the Dublin Registrar in June of 1967 and resumed law practice in the offices of his son, Micheal Brendán. He defended Neil Blaney T.D. in the Arms Trial of 1970. He was the last surviving member of the 1927 Dáil.
