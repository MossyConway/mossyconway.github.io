            <strong>VETERAN MOTORMAN HAD A RECORD OF 33 YEARS SERVICE</strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Edward Cleary, veteran motorman at the Kossuth Station, in fact an eye witness of the development of local transportation from horse and mule cars to the present modern electric system, concluded thirty-three years of service here when he died of cancer in St. John's Hospital on April 17 last.
           </p>
           <p>
            No one man in street railway service in this part of the country was more widely or more favorably known than Motorman Cleary, and his record for courtesy and efficiency in the performance of his daily duties is one that speaks for itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            His interest in his work was such that he made a close study of human nature from his viewpoint of a public servant, so that on Decembr 27 of last year, ina lengthy article in the Globe Democrat, he was able to throw some very interesting side-lights on the changes that have taken place in the temperamental qualities of street car patrons in the passing years.
           </p>
           <p>
            In that article Mr. Cleary was quoted as saying that in the days of hose and mule cars the relations between employees and the public were very happy indeed. There were no knockers riding the cars. In truth, patrons and employees were mutual friends, and the patrons always helped the car crews in their efforts to get the cars over the road. Mr. Cleary mentioned serveral instances where cars jumped the tracks, and the patrons got off and helped to place them back on the rails to keep the service going.
           </p>
           <p>
            There were no fanatics running wild in the good old days, Mr. Cleary pointed out, and no robberries or holdups on the street cars as now. And above all, the passengers all were honest and cases where passengers tried to beat the company out of its fare, were few and far between.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Cleary's first job in transportation in St. Louis was that of driver on the old Union Line, of which the late Julius Walsh was president. Starting with this company in 1885 at the age of 18, Mr. Cleary was obliged to serve an apprenticeship of one year in the car barns then located on the site of the presetn Kossuth Station at 3635 Kossuth Avenue. He remained at this station throughout his whole career.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Union line in the middle 80's extended from Fourth and Locust streets over Fifteenth to St. Louis avenue, and thence to Fairground Park. Mr. Cleary served as a car switcher and relief driver, and one of his duties was to take the car on its run while the regular driver was at lunch, and returning the car ro the regular man an hour or so later.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fare, Mr. Cleary said, was 5 cents amd it was never necessary to ask for it. The people on the cars paid it willingly by dropping the fare in a box, and many handed their money to other passengers who relayed the coin to the box. In those days there were no transfers nor trip sheets to worry about. Really, Mr. Cleary said, the only wirry in service then was in winter seasons when the mules growing tired would lie down in the snow to rest, and the car crew was compelled to wait upon their dipositions to get up again and go on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Motorman Cleary was born in Dallyhaunis, near Dublin, Ireland, the son of James Cleary, a contractor. As a youth he attended the schools in Dallyhaunis, and came to America in 1888 with his brother Thomas. Arriving here he located at once in St. Louis. His transportation career from the time of his location in this city down to date, has been cited above.
           </p>
           <p>
            Survivors of the Motorman Cleary are his widow, who was a Miss Mary A. Carr when they were married here some years ago, four children, two daughters, the Misses Adele and Florence, two sons, Joseph and Edward Cleary Junior: four brothers, John and James Cleary, who live in Ireland, and Martin and Henry of St. Louis, and three sisters, Mrs. Ellen Donnelly, Mrs. Mary Flanagan, and Mrs. Bridget Glynn.
           </p>
           <p>
            The funeral of Motorman Cleary occurred on April 20 with services in St. Matthew's Church and interment in Calvary Cemetary under the sponsorship of Sheridan Council of the Knights Columbus.
