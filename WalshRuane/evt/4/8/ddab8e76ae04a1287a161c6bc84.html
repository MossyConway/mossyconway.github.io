            This was my father and, obviously, he was named after his grandfather. He was 21 years old at the outbreak of the 1st World War. He resisted conscription into the British army; he supported Irish nationalism and independence; he opposed the partition of Ireland and he took sides in the Civil War. He was an enthusiastic supporter and promoter of his brother Michael in politics and, in his shadow, he enjoyed a good deal of notoriety. He was a hard worker, a compulsive talker and a poor listener. He was 43 years old when he married in 1936. His wife was Johanna Gibbons from Killernan near Kilmaine and she was about 13 years younger than he. They were married in Galway city and the Best Man was Willie Rattigan. (This William Rattigan was my Father’s nephew who was born in 1915 and raised from infancy by the Clearys in Logboy. He was my Godfather at my Baptism in 1944 and he eventually moved to Dublin in the early 1950s. Shortly thereafter he got married and, with his wife, Susan Keogh, emigrated to Bognor Regis in England. They had no children, his wife pre-deceased him and he himself died circa 1989. They are buried in Bognor Regis. I know he had a brother called Paddy, but why Willie became an orphan I do not know.   ----Just another family secret!). My mother’s old homestead is now a ghostly ruin where her large family lived. Two of her sisters became noted school teachers and Sisters of Mercy. One, Lena (Sr Enda), lived and died at the convent in Gort, Co. Galway and the other, Peggy (Sr Brendan), is buried at the old Convent in Belturbet, Co. Cavan.
