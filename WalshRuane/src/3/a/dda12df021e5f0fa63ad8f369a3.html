    <h4>
     Narrative
    </h4>
    <div class="grampsstylednote">
     <p>
      I never realized that my father MARTIN CLEARY, (born in 1893), was from a family of nine children:
     </p>
     <p>
      BRIDGET, the eldest, is not listed in the censes for 1901 but this may be explained by the fact she had an aunt (her mother’s sister) who was a schoolteacher on Inish Boffin (an inhabited island) and, even at nine years of age, she may have been visiting her and, perhaps, attending school there. However, I know nothing more about Bridget. It would be interesting to know if she is mentioned in the 1911 census. It would also be helpful to know whether she was registered as a pupil with her siblings Martin and Thomas and Kate and Michael at Brickens National School (close to Cossalogh).
     </p>
     <p>
      THOMAS (born in 1894) and WILLIAM JOSEPH (born in 1901). My father, Martin, and my uncle Michael, never spoke to us about these two brothers of theirs. It was only after my uncle Michael died we realized how very little we knew. We were doubly surprised to learn his family knew no more than we did and our mother maintained, to the very end, that she never thought to ask her husband or her mother-in-law any of these rather obvious questions. (Indeed, I must say she was very much prone to secrecy herself). My eldest sister, Mary Jo (born in 1937) has a hazy memory of a conversation she overheard as a little girl. The conversation had to do with a terrible accident which occurred and involved two young boys. An overladen horse-cart overturned and the two boys were killed. When the speakers realized my sister was listening they clammed up. I am quite certain William never made the move to Logboy with his parents, so, if he and his brother were killed, he would have been no more than seven years old and his brother no more than fourteen. I hasten to add, however, we have no credible information from any source to support or deny this tragedy.
     </p>
     <p>
      KATE (born in 1896). At this stage, I can tell you the move from Cossalogh to Logboy took place on the second Friday in May 1908. I heard this myself from Mary Ellen Ruane (nee Godfrey) whose family also moved there (with her) on the same auspicious day. This date is supported by the fact that 13 year old Kate registered as a pupil at Logboy National School on June 9th 1908, her 10 year old brother Michael registered on June 15th and her 8 year old sister Mary registered the following week, June 22nd 1908. Her then 3 year old sister Nellie would register the following year, April 21st 1909. I must admit, I know nothing more about Kate.
     </p>
     <p>
      MICHAEL (born 1898). There is a good deal of information on him in your records. He was highly respected locally and in Dublin.
     </p>
     <p>
      PATRICK (born in 1899). Patrick would have been 9 years old in 1908. He did not register as a pupil at Logboy School and there is no indication he ever got to Logboy. I notice his sponsors at Baptism were Edward and Margaret Glynn whom I do not know and I wonder what their connection with the family might have been. I imagine he died in childhood. I never heard of him.
     </p>
     <p>
      MARY (born in 1900). Mary attended Logboy National School. It seems, the War of Independence and the Irish Civil War and the political upheavals of her youth had an adverse impact on her life. She fell in love with a boy surnamed Duffy who was on the wrong side of the political fence from the Cleary family point of view. They eloped and fled to New Zealand. Her family disowned and ostracized her. Sometime in the 1980s a young man from New Zealand who was working on an oil rig in the North Sea (in Scotland) came across to Logboy to look up his family roots. His surname was Duffy and his grandmother was Mary Cleary. She had given birth to one child, a son, his father. She died in the process. It is probable her parents and siblings never knew that.
     </p>
     <p>
      You mention in the ‘Cleary report’ that the sponsors at Mary’s Baptism were Mr and Mrs Roger Murray who, you say, moved to Pollacapul in 1904. The Murrays were a long-established family in Derryhog and were agents of the Landlord. Roger and his wife were granted no land in Pollacapul. If they moved there in 1904, it would have been as temporary gatekeepers or custodians, I think.
     </p>
     <p>
      ELLEN (Nellie) (born in 1905). She lived on with her parents and seems to have had an attractive personality. The ‘Spanish Flu’, a European wide epidemic broke out at the end of the 1st World War and had more casualties than the war itself. I always understood it touched the Cleary family and Nellie was the victim. More recently, however, I have come to believe Nellie died from TB after the epidemic ended. Perhaps Kate was felled by the flu, --- I don’t know. Indeed, I am thoroughly amazed at how little I, or any of my siblings, know about my paternal aunts and uncles.
     </p>
     <p>
      MARTIN CLEARY (1816 – 1892)
      <br/>
      This Martin Cleary was my great-grandfather. You mention him on page 4 of the ‘Cleary Report’. His daughter (my grandfather’s sister) married James Mulkeen from Cloonbook and they had a son called Thomas who became the father of Jim (James) Mulkeen. They also had a daughter who became a Mrs Regan in Ballykilleen, the mother of three sons, Paddy, Jimmy and Hugh. (Like her own mother, she died at a young age). Mr Regan married again and became the father of two more sons Johnny and Chris. (This Chris Regan received a good education and became General Secretary to the Irish National Congress of Trade Unions. One weekend, in the mid-1960s, while hiking on the Dublin mountains, fog descended and he became disoriented and lost. Despite Nationwide publicity and exhaustive searches carried out by army and police and hundreds of volunteers he could not be found. His body was discovered the following Spring miles away from where his car was parked on the other side of the mountain) The Regans from Ballykilleen, the Mulkeens from Cloonbook and the Clearys from Logboy were cousins and extremely good friends down through the years. Jim, the last of the Mulkeens, willed the family farm to his wife’s niece Margaret Owens (nee Rattigan) and her husband Paddy. The Regans lived the batchelor life and the family name has died out too. All are buried in Tulrahan cemetery. The farm was willed to my nephew Eric Cleary who lives there at present.
     </p>
     <p>
      MICHAEL CLEARY (1853 -1929).
      <br/>
      Michael Cleary was my grandfather and your records contain just about everything I know about him. He was good looking with his moustache and black bowler hat. He was bi-lingual and could read and write. (The old people would gather periodically to listen to him read the newspaper for them, I was told). His mother was a Rattigan and he married a Rattigan but I presume they were not blood relatives. His wife came from a large family in Musicfield and I have lots of cousins I do not know in the Ballindine/Milltown area. I know a little about only two of her sisters. One of her sisters Margaret (my father’s ‘aunt Maggie’) became a school teacher and married a school teacher called Regan from the other end of Ballykilleen to the Regan family I have already mentioned. He was fond of alcohol and she thought it would be a good idea to take him to an island far away from his ‘friends’. They taught for many years in Inish Boffin and raised their family there. They are remembered for being strict and effective teachers. One of their daughters, Kitty, became a Sister of Mercy and she died just a few weeks short of her 100th birthday. She spent her working life caring for orphans in Clifden, County Galway. Another of my grandmother’s sisters was Cecilia (‘aunt Celia’). She married a David McWalter in Garrymore and they had a daughter and son. The Daughter married John Coyne, a farmer between Ballindine and Milltown and they had a large family. So, there are Coynes connected to this branch of the Cleary family as well!
     </p>
     <p>
      My grandfather Michael took his family and belongings from Cossalogh to Logboy in 1908. (Here it should be noted that Pullacappul is an extremely ill-defined place-name and is almost never used. It is also a rather derogatory name in so far as it means the rear end or the anus of a horse. It is a rather small area within Logboy itself and people in Logboy seem to agree that there were only three or four homesteads with that ‘address’). The ‘Congested Districts Board’ acquired the Landlord’s estate, divided it, erected boundary fences, built a house and barn and allocated which of the nine families went where. The Clearys did better than most in so far as they were allotted a two-story house and a two-story barn and, arguably, the most arable land. That part of the landlord’s estate had been left idle for some years and had become overgrown with thistles, gorse, briars and scrub. With none of our modern machinery in existence on small farms away back then, I imagine, the Clearys and the other families had years of back-breaking hard labor ahead of them as they struggled to improve their holdings.
     </p>
     <p>
      MARTIN CLEARY (1893 – 1970)
      <br/>
      This was my father and, obviously, he was named after his grandfather. He was 21 years old at the outbreak of the 1st World War. He resisted conscription into the British army; he supported Irish nationalism and independence; he opposed the partition of Ireland and he took sides in the Civil War. He was an enthusiastic supporter and promoter of his brother Michael in politics and, in his shadow, he enjoyed a good deal of notoriety. He was a hard worker, a compulsive talker and a poor listener. He was 43 years old when he married in 1936. His wife was Johanna Gibbons from Killernan near Kilmaine and she was about 13 years younger than he. They were married in Galway city and the Best Man was Willie Rattigan. (This William Rattigan was my Father’s nephew who was born in 1915 and raised from infancy by the Clearys in Logboy. He was my Godfather at my Baptism in 1944 and he eventually moved to Dublin in the early 1950s. Shortly thereafter he got married and, with his wife, Susan Keogh, emigrated to Bognor Regis in England. They had no children, his wife pre-deceased him and he himself died circa 1989. They are buried in Bognor Regis. I know he had a brother called Paddy, but why Willie became an orphan I do not know.   ----Just another family secret!). My mother’s old homestead is now a ghostly ruin where her large family lived. Two of her sisters became noted school teachers and Sisters of Mercy. One, Lena (Sr Enda), lived and died at the convent in Gort, Co. Galway and the other, Peggy (Sr Brendan), is buried at the old Convent in Belturbet, Co. Cavan.
      <br/>
      My Dad and Mam had seven children.
     </p>
     <p>
      MICHAEL (born 1939). From the age of seven, Michael suffered from violent epileptic fits which occurred rather frequently and without warning. He did not respond to the prescribed medication of his time and eventually needed higher care than the family could provide him. After some years at a Home in Dublin and the County Home in Castlebar, he died at the age of 28 in 1967.
     </p>
     <p>
      OTHER POINTS
      <br/>
      On page 13 of the ‘Cleary report’, the Donnellys from Ballynagron, Cuilmore Claremorris are mentioned. My father, Martin (1893 – 1970), was very friendly with that family and I remember visiting them with him a number of times when I was very young. There is no doubt my father and John Donnelly knew there was a family relationship there, but, what it is I do not know.
     </p>
     <p>
      My father, Martin, died in April 1970 and my mother died 20 years later on January 25th 1990. (Having been in Korea at the time, I missed attending both funerals). They are both buried in Tulrahan cemetery with their son Michael who died in 1967. On their tombstone my father’s name is written: ‘Mairtin O’Cleirigh.
